Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where a React component is not finding some data-testid attributes that it's testing for. The error message lists several attributes like category-card-category_1 and others that don't exist in the component. My task is to figure out how to fix this issue.

First, I'll examine the test code to see what data-testid attributes are being used. From the list provided, it looks like each category has several properties that are expected to have corresponding data-testid values. For example, there's 'category-card-category_1', which probably corresponds to an article element for a specific category.

Looking at the component, I need to check if these data-testid attributes are being set correctly. The component currently uses data-testid="category-card-" + category.id in each article's data attribute. That should cover all the categories dynamically based on their IDs.

But wait, some of the missing data-testid values include 'parent-label', 'parent-name-', and others like 'site-name-category_1'. It seems these are static or have a different structure that might not be set correctly in the component. 

Looking at how each category is rendered: for each article, there's an h3 element with data-testid={`category-name-${category.id}`}. But for parent elements and site names, it looks like they're using static strings without the correct data-testid attributes.

So maybe the test is expecting these parents and sites to have their own data-testid attributes. I should check how the component handles them.

In the current code, under category.parentName &&, there's a div with two spans that don't have any data-testid attributes. That means when the parentName exists, it displays "Parent:" followed by the name without an associated data-testid. Similarly, for site columns and other fields like order or last updated date.

To make these elements clickable in the test (assuming the test uses DataWeave to find elements based on their data-testid), I need to add the missing data-testid attributes to all relevant components.

For example:

1. The "Parent:" label should have a data-testid attribute, perhaps 'parent-label'.
2. The parentName value needs a data-testid like 'parent-name-' + category.id.
3. Similarly, site columns and other fields require their own data-testid attributes.

I'll go through each part of the component where these are missing:

- In the "Parent:" section: I should add the data-testid="parent-label" to the div containing "Parent:".
- For parentName, change it from category.parentName to include data-testid={`parent-name-${category.id}`} if that's how the test expects it. But wait, looking at the code, the current code doesn't have a data-testid for the parent name value itself. It just displays category.parentName without any attribute.

Wait no, in the code, I see:

<parent-label>Parent:</div>
<div data-testid={`parent-name-${category.id}`}>{category.parentName}</div>

So that's correct because it has a data-testid for the parentName display. But when the test is looking for 'parent-name-category_1', maybe this isn't being captured.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with other elements like site slug and date fields not having data-testid attributes. Looking at the last div in each category:

The updated-date field uses data-testid={`updated-date-${category.id}`}, which should be fine.

But the test expects 'site-name-category_1', etc., but I don't see any code that sets these data-testid values for siteName or orderValue. So maybe those are missing from the component, causing the tests to fail.

So, in the current component:

- The category.card article has a data-testid="category-card-" + id.
- Each sub-element inside (like parent name) uses a specific data-testid based on some pattern.
But for site slug and other fields like order or updated date, there are no corresponding data-testid attributes defined.

Therefore, to fix the issue, I need to add data-testid attributes for these missing elements. Let's see:

In each category article:
- The childCount is inside a div with data-testid="child-count-" + id.
But site slug and other fields like orderValue and updatedDate are not covered.

Looking at the test's expected dataWeidues, they include 'site-name-category_1', etc. So these should be added as data-testid attributes for their respective elements.

So I need to:

- For each category, create a div with a data-testid="site-name-" + id containing {category.siteName}.
- Similarly, add data-testid attributes like "order-value-" + id for order, and perhaps others if needed.
Wait, but looking at the test's expected attributes: it includes 'child-count-category_1' which is already handled. But also other attributes that are not present.

So in the component:

In each category article:
- The parent section has a data-testid for the label and name.
But site slug is a separate field. So perhaps we need to add another div after or before that with a data-testid like "site-slug-" + id, containing {category.site}.
Similarly, orderValue should have data-testid="order-value-" + id.

Wait no, in the code, it's already using an h3 for category name and parent sections. The site slug would be another field, perhaps as part of a sub-section within each category. Alternatively, maybe it's a separate section but without any data-testid attribute, causing the test to fail when looking for it.

Alternatively, perhaps the component is not rendering these fields at all or isn't setting their data-testid attributes correctly. So I need to add those.

So putting it all together:

The plan is to modify each category article by adding the missing data-testid attributes and corresponding elements. For example:

1. After displaying the parent information, add a div with data-testid="site-slug-" + id containing {category.site}.
2. Add another section for order value with data-testid="order-value-" + id.
3. Similarly, maybe others like date fields.

But looking back at the test's expected attributes, it lists site-slug and other fields but perhaps those are not being rendered correctly in the component.

Alternatively, maybe each category has a fixed structure that includes these elements without corresponding data-testid attributes, which is why the tests fail.

So to fix this:

- I'll need to ensure every dynamic field (like parentName, childCount, siteName, orderValue) has a data-testid attribute set to something like "parent-name-" + id, "child-count-" + id, etc.
Looking at the code, that's already handled for some but not all.

Wait, in the component:

- The category.card uses data-testid="category-card-" + id. Correct.
- The parent section: has a label and name with data-testid for the name (parent-name). So correct.
But site slug is another field that's part of each category article? Or maybe it's not being displayed unless category.site exists.

Similarly, orderValue might be in an input element without a data-testid attribute.

Looking at the code:

Each category article has:
<div>
  <h3>...</h3>
  <div parent stuff...>
  ... 
</div>

But I don't see any data-testid for site or date fields. So perhaps these are missing and need to be added.

Alternatively, maybe they're present as static values without data-testid attributes, causing the test to fail because it expects a dynamic value with a specific attribute.

So the fix would involve adding data-testid attributes where necessary and setting their corresponding display text accordingly.

Therefore, I'll proceed to modify each category article by:

- Adding a div for site slug with data-testid="site-slug-" + id.
- Adding another section for order value (if it's present) with its own data-testid attribute.
Wait, but in the code provided, there is no explicit 'order' field. Wait, looking at the test, the expected attributes include 'orderValue', so perhaps each category has an input or element related to that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some parts of the component that handle these fields.

In any case, based on the test's list:

- Missing dataWeidues: parentLabel, parentName (though it seems parentName is set), site-slug, and others like orderValue, lastUpdateDate, etc.

So to fix this, I'll go through each part of the component where these are missing.

First, for 'site-slug' field:

I should add a div with data-testid="site-slug-" + category.id containing {category.site} or similar.

Similarly, for orderValue, lastUpdateDate, etc., if they're present as elements without dataWeidues.

Wait, in the code provided, I don't see any such fields. So maybe those are part of other sections like the slug or date, but perhaps it's missing from this component.

But given that the test expects these attributes, perhaps each category article needs to include them with their respective data-testid attributes.

So, for example:

In the category.card element:
- h3: data-testid="category-name-" + id
- parent section: already has dataWeidues.
- After that, add a div with data-testid="site-slug-" + id containing site slug text.
- Then, an input or element for orderValue with data-testid="order-value-" + id.

Similarly, perhaps other fields like lastUpdateDate should have their own data-testid attributes.

But in the given code snippet, I don't see any of these. So maybe that's where the problem isâ€”they're not being added dynamically, hence causing the test to fail because they expect those attributes but they aren't set.

So, putting it all together:

I'll modify each category article by adding data-testid attributes for site-slug, order-value, and possibly others like lastUpdateDate. Also, ensuring that the parent sections are correctly handled with their own dataWeidues.

Wait, in the given code snippet, I don't see an 'orderValue' being rendered. So perhaps it's part of another section not provided here. Alternatively, maybe each category has such fields and elements without corresponding dataWeidues.

In any case, to fix this:

Each category article should be updated with the missing dataWeidues so that when the test looks for them, they exist dynamically.

Therefore, I'll proceed step by step to add these attributes where necessary.
</think>

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure each dynamic field within a category's article has its corresponding `data-testid` attribute set. Here's how we can fix it:

1. **Add Dynamic Fields with DataWeidues:**
   - For each field that should have a dynamic value (like `site-slug`, `orderValue`, and `lastUpdateDate`), add a `<div>` element with the appropriate `data-testid`.
   
2. **Include Parent Section Elements:**
   - Ensure parent sections include elements like `<input>` for `orderValue` or other relevant fields, each set to their specific `data-testid`.

3. **Ensure Proper Structure:**
   - Organize each category's article by sequentially adding the necessary fields and ensuring all dynamic attributes are correctly referenced.

Here is the fixed code:

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="field">
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
    <div>
      <input type="text" 
             placeholder="Title"
             id="title"
             name="title"
             value="{{ item.title }}"
             data-testid="category-name-{{ item.id }}">
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Parent Section -->
  <div class="parent">
    <div>
      <label for="parentLabel" id="parentLabel">Parent</label>
      <input type="text"
             id="parentId"
             name="parentId"
             placeholder="Enter parent code"
             value="{{ item.parent }}"
             data-testid="parent-name-{{ item.id }}">
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Site Slug -->
  <div class="site-slug">
    <div>
      <input type="text" 
             id="siteSlugInput"
             name="siteSlug"
             placeholder="Site slug"
             value="{{ item.site_slug }}"
             data-testid="site-slug-{{ item.id }}">
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Order Value -->
  <div class="order-value">
    <input type="text" 
           id="orderValueInput"
           name="orderValue"
           placeholder="Order value"
           value="{{ item.order_value }}"
           data-testid="order-value-{{ item.id }}">
  </div>

  <!-- Last Update Date -->
  <div class="last-update-date">
    <input type="datetime-local" 
           id="updateDateInput"
           name="updateDate"
           placeholder="Last updated"
           value="{{ item.last_updated }}"
           data-testid="lastUpdateDate-{{ item.id }}">
  </div>
</div>
```

**Changes Made:**

1. **Dynamic Fields Added:**
   - Added `<input>` elements for `site-slug`, `order-value`, and `last-updated` with corresponding `data-testid` attributes.

2. **Proper Referencing:**
   - Each dynamic field now correctly references its own `data-testid`, ensuring that the test can dynamically fetch values based on the category's slug.

3. **Organized Structure:**
   - Categories are structured sequentially, starting from the title, moving to parent information, followed by site slug, order value, and last update date. Each section is clearly defined with its own input field.

This ensures that all dynamic fields have their respective `data-testid` attributes set correctly, allowing the test to dynamically fetch values without issues.
