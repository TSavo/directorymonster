## Generated Diff
<think>
Alright, I'm faced with an issue where a React component is missing some required `data-testid` attributes that are being tested for in the tests. The problem seems to be that these attributes aren't present in any of the components generated by the current code.

Looking at the provided code snippet, specifically the `SiteMobileCard` component, I notice several buttons and elements with `data-testid` attributes. However, none of them seem to match what's being tested: 'mobile-site-name', 'mobile-site-slug', etc.

I start by identifying which parts of the UI might correspond to these missing attributes. The test expects these attributes because it's likely checking for specific interactions or events in the mobile view. 

First, I look at the name display. In the component, there's a heading that shows the site's name: `<h1 {...} className="font-bold text-gray-900">Name</h1>`. This would be a good candidate to add the missing 'mobile-site-name' attribute.

Next, for the slug, which is similar but might have its own specific event or identifier. The component already displays `site.slug` in an `<em>` tag within the description section. I can add another button here with the key as the slug and a data-testid of 'mobile-site-slug'.

Then, considering domains, each domain link has a `data-testid` that's currently set to something like `site.mobile-domain-${index}`. This could be adjusted or kept consistent if needed.

I also notice missing buttons for actions like edit and delete. The test expects these attributes: 'mobile-edit-button' and 'mobile-delete-button'. I'll add these buttons with the appropriate data-testid names in their respective sections.

By adding these attributes, the component will correctly respond to the tests, ensuring that all expected interactions are properly linked to their respective event handlers or UI elements.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure our `SiteMobileCard` component includes the missing `data-testid` attributes that the test expects. 

1. **Name Attribute (`mobile-site-name`)**: Add a button in the name section with this attribute.
2. **Slug Attribute (`mobile-site-slug`)**: Create a button for the slug value within the description.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

```

This adds the missing `data-testid` attributes for name and slug while keeping existing domain buttons consistent.
