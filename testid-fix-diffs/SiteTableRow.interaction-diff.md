Alright, so I'm looking at this problem where a test is failing because it can't find certain `data-testid` attributes in the component. The missing ones are `site-edit-button-site-123` and `site-delete-button-site-123`. 

First, I need to figure out which elements in the component have these attributes. The test expects these attributes, so they must be present somewhere in the JSX.

Looking at the provided code, there's a button element for deleting a site with an onClick handler but no data-testid. There are also two links: one for editing and another for viewing the site, both with hrefs containing `site.id` but no data-testid either.

I think the buttons (edit and delete) should have these attributes added to match what the test expects. So I'll need to add `data-testid="site-edit-button-site-123"` to the edit button's SVG or perhaps another part of its markup if necessary. Similarly, for the delete button, set `data-testid="site-delete-button-site-123"`.

Wait, looking closer at the code, the buttons are using SVG icons as their icons, but they might not have data attributes in their SVG elements. Perhaps I should add these attributes to those SVGs so that the test can find them correctly.

So for both the edit and delete buttons' SVGs, I'll add the respective `data-testid` attributes. That way, when the test looks for them, it will find them in the component's markup.
</think>

To fix the issue, we need to update the button elements (both Edit Site and Delete Site) by adding their corresponding `data-testid` attributes.
