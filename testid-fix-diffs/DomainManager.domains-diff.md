Okay, so I have this problem where a test is failing because it can't find some data-testid attributes in the DomainManager component. The missing ones are domainManager-remove-domain-0 and domainManager-remove-domain-1. 

First, I need to figure out where these attributes are used in the test. Since the test is looking for them but they don't exist in the component, it's probably because the component isn't rendering buttons with those specific data-testid names.

Looking at the provided code, I see that there's a removeDomain function and some event listeners attached to buttons. But wait, in the JSX, I'm only seeing addDomain and cancel buttons. The remove buttons are likely missing from the UI part of the component.

So, I should check if those remove buttons exist elsewhere in the component. Hmm, maybe they're inside a form or another div that's not shown here. Alternatively, perhaps the test is adding these data-testid attributes to simulate clicks on those buttons.

If the component doesn't have elements with those data-testid attributes, then either the test needs to be updated or the component needs to include those buttons so the test can find them.

But since the user prefers adding the missing attributes to the component, I'll focus on that. Looking at where these buttons would typically appear—maybe when a domain is selected and options are shown—I should add similar buttons for remove functionality in the component's JSX.

I'll locate where the domains are displayed. Suppose there's a grid or list of domains where each selection has an option to remove it. For each such domain, I'll add a button with onClick={removeDomain} and include the appropriate data-testid attributes.

So, I'll go into that part of the component, find the domain items, and for each one, insert a new button element after the Add button but before the Cancel button. This way, when the test looks for remove-domain-0, it will find the first remove button, and so on.

I should also make sure to include disabled handling based on isLoading or any necessary conditions so that the buttons aren't enabled while loading.

Once those buttons are added with their data-testid attributes, the component will have all the required properties, allowing the test to pass without issues.

To fix the issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the remove domain buttons in the component. Here's how:

This adds the missing `data-testid` attributes to the remove buttons. Each button is added within a loop that iterates over all domains, ensuring every domain has its own remove button with an appropriate data-testid attribute.
