<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out why there's a mismatch between the test and the actual component regarding the data-testid attributes. Let me start by looking at what the user provided.

The test is expecting two data-testid attributes: add-domain-button and remove-domain-0. But when I look at the component code, specifically the buttons inside the "Add Domain" section, it seems like those attributes aren't present.

In the component, the add button has a data-testid called "domainStep-add-domain". The test is expecting "add-domain-button", which doesn't match. Similarly, for the remove buttons, each one in the loop uses "domainStep-remove-domain-" plus the index as a string, but the test expects "remove-domain-0".

So, there are two possibilities: either the component needs to have its data-testid attributes updated, or the test's expectations need to change.

Since the user suggested adding the missing attributes to the component is preferred, I'll focus on that. The correct data URIs should match what the test expects. 

Looking at the add button in the component, it uses "domainStep-add-domain". But the test expects "add-domain-button", so we need to change that to match.

For the remove buttons, each one currently has a unique identifier based on their index in the loop. However, the test is looking for "remove-domain-0" when the first domain is present. So I think it's better to standardize the data-testid by appending an 'n' suffix instead of using the index number.

So, I'll update each remove button's data-testid from `domainStep-remove-domain-${index}` to `domainStep-remove-domain-n`. This way, they become "remove-domain-0", "remove-domain-1", etc., which should align with the test's expectations.

Now, applying these changes in the diff format. In the component file, I'll modify the onClick handlers of both buttons: changing the add button's data-testid to match the test and updating each remove button from using index to n suffix.
</think>

To fix the mismatch between test and component regarding `data-testid`, we need to:
1. Update the `add-domain-button` in the component
2. Standardize `remove-domain-x` to follow a consistent naming pattern of `remove-domain-n`
