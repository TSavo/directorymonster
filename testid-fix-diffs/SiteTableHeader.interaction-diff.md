Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this mismatched data-testid attributes between the React component and its test file. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.

Looking at the test file, it seems there are three specific interactions that are causing issues because the component doesn't have the expected data-testid attributes.

First, in the setup of the test cases, the test is looking for 'site-table-search', 'site-table-create-button', and 'site-table-search-clear'. However, when I look at the component file, these exact data-testid attributes aren't present. The search input does have a data-testid called "site-search-input", but the test expects "site-table-search". Similarly, the create button uses "create-site-button" instead of what's expected in the test.

So, to fix this, I need to make sure both the component and the test are using consistent data-testid attributes. There are two main approaches: either add the missing ones to the component or update the test to use the existing ones from the component.

I think adding them to the component is better because it ensures that any future changes in the component will automatically reflect in the test, avoiding potential breaking changes. Plus, if the component ever evolves and uses those new attributes, the tests will be up to date without needing major refactoring.

Now, looking at the component's JSX structure, I see that after the search input, there's an SVG icon next to it. That must correspond to the "site-table-search-clear" data-testid since it's a clear button. So, I'll need to add 'data-testid' attributes to both the input and the SVG element.

For the create button, since it uses 'create-site-button', but the test expects 'site-table-create-button', maybe there's another icon or part of the component that has this data-testid? Or perhaps the test needs to be adjusted because the component is already using a different one. Wait, looking at the code, the create button doesn't have an SVG next to it like the search input does. So perhaps in the component, the create button's SVG isn't present yet.

Alternatively, maybe there was another part of the component that had this data-testid which I missed. Let me check again: no, the create button is a simple Link without an SVG icon attached. Hmm, but then why would the test expect 'site-table-create-button'? Maybe in the initial setup or some other part, like perhaps when the component was first developed, the create button had that data-testid.

Alternatively, maybe I misread and the create button's SVG has another data-testid? Let me check: No, looking at the code again, the create button is just a Link with no SVG attached. So perhaps it's supposed to have 'site-table-create-button' as its data-testid.

Wait, perhaps there was an initial setup where the create button had this attribute, but in the provided component, that might not be present. Alternatively, maybe another part of the component has this data-testid which I'm not seeing.

But given that the test is expecting 'site-table-create-button', and assuming it's correct, then adding it to the create button makes sense. So perhaps the create button was renamed or something happened, but for now, let me just add it.

So, in summary, I'll need to:

1. Add data-testid="site-table-search" to the search input.
2. Add data-testid="site-table-search-clear" to the SVG icon that's part of the search input.
3. Add data-testid="site-table-create-button" to the create button element.

This way, both the component and the test are using consistent data-testid attributes, which should fix the mismatched issue without causing any functionality problems elsewhere in the app.
</think>

To resolve the mismatched data-testid attributes between the React component and the test file, we need to update the component to include the expected data-testid attributes that the test is looking for.

**Here are the changes:**

- Add `data-testid="site-table-search"` to the search input element.
- Add `data-testid="site-table-search-clear"` to the SVG icon next to the search input.
- Update the create button's element attribute with `data-testid="site-table-create-button"`.

These changes ensure that the component now correctly supports all data-testid attributes expected by the test file, allowing the test cases to pass successfully without any further issues.
