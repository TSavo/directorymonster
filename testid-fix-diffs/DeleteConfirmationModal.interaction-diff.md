Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is looking for data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component. The problem seems to be with two specific attributes: delete-modal-confirm and delete-modal-cancel.

First, I'll look at the code provided. In the JSX, there's a button element with an onClick handler pointing to onConfirm. This button has some classes but no data-testid attributes. The test is expecting these attributes to exist because it seems they were used in previous versions or configurations.

I need to determine where these data-testid values should come from. Since the test is failing due to missing attributes, adding them directly to the component's code might be a straightforward solution. The data-testid attributes are typically set on SVG icons that represent confirm and cancel buttons. 

Looking at how similar components are handled elsewhere, I remember seeing that sometimes you attach these attributes to the SVG elements of the icons themselves. So in this case, the delete-modal-confirm is likely tied to an SVG that's part of the DeleteConfirmationModal component.

I should check if there's an existing SVG element somewhere in the component where these data-testid values are set. If so, adding the attributes to that SVG would make sense. Without seeing the entire component code, I'll assume that modifying the parent button isn't enough and that the correct approach is to add the attributes to the appropriate elements.

Alternatively, if the SVGs aren't part of this component's structure anymore, maybe they were removed or moved elsewhere. But since the user mentioned it's a separate issue, perhaps adding these data-testid values directly on the buttons would work as an interim fix.

So, I'll go ahead and add both delete-modal-confirm and delete-modal-cancel attributes to the button element in the code.

To resolve the missing data-testid attributes issue, we need to add the `data-testid` properties to the button. These attributes should correspond to 'delete-modal-confirm' for the confirm icon and 'delete-modal.cancel' for the cancel icon.
