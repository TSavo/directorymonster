<think>
Okay, so I've got this problem where a test is failing because it can't find some missing data-testid attributes in the SiteForm component. The specific attributes are siteForm-name, siteForm-slug, siteForm-description, next-button, and siteForm-submit-loading.

First, I need to figure out why these attributes aren't present. Looking at the provided code snippet of the SiteForm component, I see that it's rendering several elements with data-testid attributes. But for the mentioned missing ones, there's no such property defined in any of the components like BasicInfoStep or DomainStep.

The test is expecting these attributes to exist when they're being set. Maybe the test is using them to identify specific events or interactions within the form. Since these aren't present in the component, rendering issues arise when the test tries to access them.

Now, considering the options for fixing this:

1. **Add Missing Data-testid Attributes:** The most straightforward approach would be to add these attributes to the components that render elements which might have their own data-testid properties. For example, if BasicInfoStep has an input or button with a data-testid like siteForm-name, adding it there makes sense.

2. **Update the Test:** Alternatively, if the test is correctly using these attributes and they're supposed to be part of the component's structure but aren't present, then either the components (like BasicInfoStep) need to have their data-testid updated or the test should use different ones that do exist.

3. **Use Mocks in the Test:** If the issue arises during testing due to missing attributes on the DOM elements rendered by the component, using mocks for these elements with the correct data-testid would help. But since the code isn't provided here, it's harder to assess if this is feasible.

Between these options, adding the missing data-testid attributes directly in the components seems like the best approach because it keeps everything within the component itself, making it consistent and future-proof.

So, I'll need to go through each step in the JSX and check where a data-testid might be relevant. For instance:

- The name field: Perhaps BasicInfoStep has an input element with data-testid="siteForm-name".
- The slug: Maybe DomainStep includes an input that uses data-testid="siteForm-slug".
- The description: Similarly, an input in BasicInfoStep could have data-testid="siteForm-description".
- Next button: There's a <button> tag without a data-testid. If the test expects it to be "next-button", adding that attribute.
- Submit button: Another <button> with data-testid="siteForm-submit-loading".

I'll go through each step and add these attributes where appropriate, ensuring they're properly scoped within their respective components.

Once added, the component should correctly expose all the required data-testid attributes, allowing the test to pass without issues. Then, I can prepare a diff showing these additions.

To fix the issue with missing `data-testid` attributes in the SiteForm component, we need to add the missing attributes to their respective components.
