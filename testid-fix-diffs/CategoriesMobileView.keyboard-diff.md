Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is failing because it can't find certain data-testid attributes in the component. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, looking at the test provided, I see that it's expecting elements like 'view-button-category_1', 'edit-button-category_1', and so on. These are not present as data-testid attributes in the component, which is why the test fails when trying to find them.

So, the problem must be that the component doesn't have these data-testid attributes defined anywhere. The test relies on these attributes being there, but they're missing from the component file.

I check the component files given. The index.ts file exports several components with data-testid attributes based on their default exports. For example, it has 'data-testid="DeleteConfirmationModal"' for the DeleteConfirmationModal component. However, I don't see any other data-testid attributes defined in this file or its subcomponents like CategoriesMobileView.

Looking at the test setup, when rendering the CategoriesMobileView, these buttons are created without specifying data-testid attributes. So either the component isn't providing them, or they're not correctly assigned in the component's JSX.

The solution is to add these missing data-testid attributes to both the component and its children so that when the test tries to find them, they exist. Without these attributes, the test can't accurately interact with those buttons using keyboard events like Enter or Space.

By adding these attributes, I ensure that each button has a unique identifier in the DOM, making it easier for the test to locate and activate them correctly. This should resolve the issue where the test couldn't find the expected elements.
</think>

To fix the issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to both the component's children (buttons) and ensure they're defined in the component file.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. In the CategoriesMobileView component, add data-testid attributes for each button type:
   - Add a unique data-testid attribute for each view, edit, and delete button.
2. Ensure these buttons exist within their respective subcomponents (like CategoryTableEmptyState or CategoryTableActions).
