Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix the mismatched data-testid attributes between the React component and its test file. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The test file is looking for a data-testid attribute called 'security-indicator' that doesn't exist in the component. So, either the component isn't setting this attribute correctly, or the test needs to reference it properly.

Looking at the provided files, the test is using screen-by-id and screen-byTestId methods. In React components, data-testid attributes are often set on elements like buttons or inputs to indicate user interaction, such as password strength.

In the test case 'validates password length', there's an expectation that when a weak password is entered, the security indicator changes to red, and after a stronger password, it turns green. This suggests that the component should have a button element with data-testid="security-indicator".

I check the index.ts file and notice that each component (like ZKPLoginComponent) doesn't include any buttons or elements with specific data-testid attributes. So, probably, the ZKPLoginComponent is missing this attribute.

In the test, when the password is entered, it looks for the screen element with a text query of /password/i and also checks for the test id 'security-indicator'. But since the component doesn't have an element with that test ID yet, the test fails because the screen element isn't found by the test's method.

So, the solution would be to add a button in the ZKPLoginComponent with data-testid="security-indicator". This way, when the user types into the password input, React will trigger this attribute, making it visible as a button. The test can then correctly find and verify this element using its attributes.

I'll need to edit the component file to add this button. I'll insert the button right before or after the password input section so that it's relevant when testing password strength.
</think>

To fix the issue where the test is looking for a missing data-testid attribute, we need to update the ZKPLoginComponent to include a button with data-testid="security-indicator". This will make sure React correctly sets and maintains this attribute as user inputs change.

Here's how we'll modify the component:

1. Add a button element right before the password input section.
2. Include the data-testid attribute on the button for proper React interaction.

This change adds the `data-testid` attribute to the button element, ensuring React correctly identifies and responds to changes in the security indicator when typing into the password input.
