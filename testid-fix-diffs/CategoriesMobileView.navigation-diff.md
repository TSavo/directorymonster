Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is failing because it can't find certain data-testid attributes in the component. The test file is looking for 'view-button-category_1', 'edit-button-category_1', and 'delete-button-category_1', but these don't exist in the component.

First, I need to check what's happening in both the test and the component. Looking at the test, it uses mock elements with data-testid attributes. The component, however, might not be using these same attributes, which is why the mocks are failing when trying to find them.

In the test file, there's a section where mocks are set up for actions like on View, Edit, and Delete buttons. But I don't see any setup for the delete button specifically. That could be one issue—the test might not be setting up the delete button mock correctly.

Looking at the component index.ts, it exports several categories of components but doesn't show the actual MobileView component where these buttons are rendered. So perhaps in that component, the buttons aren't assigned data-testid attributes, which is why the mocks in the test can't find them.

I think the best approach here is to add these missing data-testid attributes to both the view and edit buttons in the component. This way, when the mock elements in the test are looking for them, they'll exist in the DOM tree.

So I'll go into the MobileView component (assuming that's where these buttons are defined) and find the button elements. For each of the three buttons—view, edit, delete—I'll add a data-testid attribute with the corresponding test ID.

But wait, how do I know which classes or IDs to attach them to? Since the test is expecting specific attributes, maybe it's better to just assign the data-testid directly without any extra classes. That way, the browser will look for the exact attribute value provided.

Alternatively, if there are other styles or class names on these buttons in the component, I should include those along with the data-testid. However, since the test might be relying solely on the data-testid attribute to find them, adding it without extra classes could simplify things and prevent unexpected behavior elsewhere.

So, in summary, I'll modify the MobileView component by adding the three data-testid attributes for each button. This should make sure that when the mocks are set up in the test, they can correctly reference these elements.

To fix the issue where the test is failing to find the missing `data-testid` attributes, we need to add them to both the view and edit buttons in the component.

Here's the change:

1. In the MobileView component, modify the button elements for the delete action by adding the necessary `data-testid` attribute.
2. Update all three buttons (view, edit, delete) to include their respective test IDs as data attributes.

This ensures that when the mocks are set up in the test file, they can correctly locate and reference these elements using the expected IDs.
