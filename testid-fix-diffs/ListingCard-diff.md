Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is looking for a data-testid attribute called "mocked-image" that doesn't exist in the component. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the problem is. The user provided some code snippets and mentioned that the test is failing because it can't find the "mocked-image" data-testid. This means that either the component isn't using this attribute correctly, or the test is expecting something that doesn't exist in the component's structure.

Looking at the code given, I see that there are elements like <div>, <h1>, <p>, and some custom SVG elements. Then there are sections dealing with metadata about listingsâ€”like review counts, ratings, etc. But nowhere in this component do I see any data-testid attributes being used or defined.

So, since the test is expecting a "mocked-image" data-testid but it's not present, maybe that's because the component doesn't include such an element. Or perhaps the image isn't added with the correct data-testid attribute.

I need to check if there's an image element in the component where I can add the data-testid="mocked-image". If so, adding that attribute would fix it by associating the image with the test's expectation.

Alternatively, maybe the test is using mocks or some testing framework that expects this attribute elsewhere. So perhaps I should look at how the tests are set up and see if they're correctly providing these attributes to the component.

But given that the user prefers adding the missing data-testid attributes directly in the component, I'll focus on modifying the JSX structure. If there's an image tag (like <img> or a wrapper around it), adding data-testid="mocked-image" there should make it available for the test to pick up.

I also notice that other parts of the code have meta tags with itemProp attributes, which might be fine as they don't relate to data-testid. So my main focus is on the visual elements where such attributes are typically used.

In conclusion, I'll add the data-testid attribute to any relevant image element in the component so that it's recognized by the test.
</think>

To fix the issue, we need to ensure the component includes a `data-testid` attribute for "mocked-image". Since there's an SVG and other elements but no image tag with this attribute, we'll add it.
