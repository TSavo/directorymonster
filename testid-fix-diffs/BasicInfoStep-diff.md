Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is looking for some data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component. Let me start by understanding what's going on.

Looking at the test file, BasicInfoStep.test.tsx, it imports the BasicInfoStep component and uses it in two test cases. In both of these tests, there are checks using screen.getByTestId() for various data-testid attributes that aren't present in the component.

In the test case 'renders all form fields correctly', I see expectations for 'site-form-name', 'site-form-slug', 'site-form-description' as well as their helper text. Similarly, in the second test, it checks these values and the helper text again.

Now, looking at the component file, BasicInfoStep.tsx, I don't see any data-testid attributes defined on the labels or inputs. The inputs have data-testid="siteForm-name", etc., but those are different from what the tests are expecting—site-form-name instead of siteForm-name.

So, the problem is that the test expects the component to have certain data-testid attributes like 'site-form-name', but the component uses a different naming convention for these attributes. To fix this, I need to make sure that either the component includes these correct data-testid attributes or the test updates its expectations.

Since modifying the tests might be outside the scope if the component is supposed to use a different structure, adding the missing attributes to the component would be more appropriate. The test expects 'site-form-name', which suggests that those are the intended attributes for labeling each form field in the UI.

So, I should add data-testid="site-form-name", data-testid="site-form-slug", and data-testid="site-form-description" to each of their respective labels or inputs in the component. But looking at the code, the labels don't have data-testid set, only the inputs do. Wait, no—the test is probably looking for the labels' data-testid attributes.

Wait, maybe I should check how the component's UI looks when rendered with these attributes. The labels might not need data-testid if it's the text that triggers the interaction, but perhaps in this case, they do because of some accessibility or click event handling.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the test is using the wrong identifiers for the elements. So to align them, I should update the component to include these data-testid attributes on either the labels or inputs as expected by the tests.

Given that the test expects 'site-form-name', etc., perhaps those are meant to be on the labels. But in the current code, the labels don't have data-testid set, so adding that there would fix it. Alternatively, if the data-testid should be on the input elements, then changing those from siteForm- to site-form- would solve the issue.

Wait, looking at the component's code:

In each input field (name, slug, description), the data-testid is "siteForm-name", etc. So perhaps the test expects 'site-form-name' instead of 'siteForm-name'. Therefore, updating those attributes in the component to use site-form- would align them with what the tests are looking for.

Alternatively, maybe the labels themselves should have these data-testid attributes if they're being used elsewhere. But I think it's more likely that the input fields are where these attributes should be added because the test is probably targeting the elements by their names in the UI after rendering.

So, to fix this, I'll need to modify each of the input fields' data-testid attributes from 'siteForm-' to 'site-form-'. For example, changing data-testid="siteForm-name" to data-testid="site-form-name". This way, when the test runs and looks for these attributes, they will be present.

I also notice that the helper text in the third test case refers to site-form-slug-helper. The component doesn't have a corresponding input with this attribute, but perhaps it's an error or maybe the helper is part of another element. However, since this issue only mentions three main data-testid attributes not existing, I'll focus on those first.

So, in summary, adding data-testid="site-form-name", "site-form-slug", and "site-form-description" to the input fields where they are currently using 'siteForm-' would fix the problem. This will ensure that when the test looks for these attributes, they exist as expected.
</think>

To resolve the issue with missing `data-testid` attributes in the component, we need to update the component to include the correct data-testid values that match what's being tested.
