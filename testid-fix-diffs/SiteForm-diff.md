Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is failing because some data-testid attributes are missing from the component. Let me see what the problem is.

Looking at the provided code and the list of missing data-testid attributes, I need to figure out which parts of the component are using these attributes but aren't present.

First, the test is looking for siteForm-basic-info-heading, siteForm-name, etc. These probably correspond to specific elements in the component that use the data-testid prop.

In the code, there's a header element with className and some JSX. It has a data-testid called "siteForm-header". That makes sense because it's part of the form title. So maybe the basic_info step also needs its own data-testid for headings or buttons?

Wait, looking at the test errors, the missing attributes include siteForm-basic-info-heading. That suggests that in the component, there might be a header specific to the basic info step. In the code, when activeStep is 'basic_info', a BasicInfoStep is rendered inside the step-content div.

But maybe this BasicInfoStep has its own heading or buttons without specifying data-testid correctly. Or perhaps the test expects additional elements that aren't being provided by the component.

Another point is siteForm-name and siteForm-slug, which might be part of form fields but not explicitly using data-testid props. Maybe these are labels or inputs elsewhere in the component.

Similarly, domainStep-heading, domainStep-domain-input, etc., suggest that the DomainStep has elements like a heading, input field, add/remove buttons, each expecting a data-testid attribute.

Looking at the code again, after the step-content div comes FormActions with next and previous buttons. The test expects 'next-button' and 'step-button-domains', so perhaps these buttons are missing data-testid attributes.

Also, there's an element called cancel-button in the test, which probably refers to a button that's part of the form but isn't present or doesn't have the correct data-testid set.

So, I think the approach is to identify where each missing data-testid should be added. For example:

- The BasicInfoStep might need its own heading with data-testid "siteForm-basic-info-heading".
- Each input field in DomainStep (domain-input) needs a data-testid.
- The buttons for adding/removing domains (add-domain, remove-domain) and the cancel button each require their data-testid attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps these data-testid attributes are already defined elsewhere but aren't being used correctly. Maybe they're part of other elements that render together.

I should also check if the FormActions component has all the buttons referenced by the test. The test expects next-button, step-button-domains (maybe for domains), and cancel-button, so those might be separate from the form steps.

So to fix this, I need to go through each missing data-testid in the test and ensure that their corresponding elements in the component have these attributes set. For instance:

1. Add data-testid="siteForm-basic-info-heading" to the BasicInfoStep's header.
2. Ensure all input fields, like domain-input, have their respective data-testid attributes.
3. Update buttons for adding/removing domains with data-testid props.
4. Make sure the Cancel button has data-testid set.

Since I can't see the exact component structure beyond what's provided, but based on standard form steps and UI elements, these are likely where the missing attributes should be added. Each element that needs to trigger an action in the test (like next or cancel) must have a corresponding data-testid pointing to its HTML element.
</think>

To resolve the issue of missing `data-testid` attributes in the component, we need to add the appropriate props to each element. Here's how:

1. **Basic Info Step Header**: Add a heading element with `data-testid="siteForm-basic-info-heading"`.
2. **Input Fields**: Ensure each input (e.g., for domain name) has its data-testid specified.
3. **Domain Addition/Removal Buttons**: Assign `data-testid` to buttons like `add-domain` and `remove-domain`.
4. **Cancel Button**: Include a `data-testid` for the cancel button.

Here is the necessary code change:

These changes ensure that each element triggers the correct actions in the test by providing the necessary `data-testid` attributes.
