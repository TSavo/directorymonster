Okay, I need to help fix a mismatch between the test and the React component regarding the data-testid attribute. The test is looking for 'auth-status', which isn't present in the component.

First, I'll look at where the test gets its data from. In the LogoutTestComponent, there's a <p> element with data-testid="auth-status". Maybe that's not being set correctly on the component.

Looking at the component file, index.ts, I see no mention of 'auth-status' in any of the components listed. So perhaps each child component is supposed to have this data-testid. Alternatively, maybe the parent component should handle it.

In LogoutTestComponent, when using screen.getByTestId(), the test expects 'auth-status'. If that's not present on the component, the test fails. So I need to add data-testid="auth-status" to all relevant elements in each child component.

I'll check each component file and make sure they have this attribute where necessary. For instance, if there are buttons or elements with roles like 'status' or named 'authStatus', adding data-testid should help.

Alternatively, maybe the parent component is not passing down the data-testid to its children. So I should ensure that when components render each other, their data-testid attributes are correctly set so they show up in the test's screen.

So, the minimal fix might be to modify each child component (like LogoutButtonComponent) to include data-testid="auth-status" on relevant elements. This way, during rendering, the test will pick it up and find the expected attribute.
</think>

To resolve the mismatched data-testid issue between the test and component, I'll update the LogoutTestComponent in the index.ts file to add data-testid attributes.

This change adds the missing data-testid attribute to the authentication object in the useAuth hook, ensuring it's visible during tests.
