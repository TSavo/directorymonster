Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is looking for some missing data-testid attributes in the component but they don't exist. The user has provided both the component code and a list of data-testid names that are causing problems.

First, I'll look at the problem. The test expects five specific data-testid attributes: delete-modal, delete-modal-title, delete-modal-content, delete-modal-confirm, and delete-modal-cancel. However, these aren't present in the current component. That's why the test is failingâ€”they don't exist on any elements within the component.

Looking at the code, I see that there are two buttons inside a modal div. Each button has an onClick handler but doesn't have data-testid attributes yet. So, to align with what the test expects, each of these buttons needs to have their respective data-testid set.

The next step is identifying which data-testid goes where. The confirm delete button is likely supposed to be "delete-modal-confirm" because it's asking for confirmation. On the other hand, the cancel button should probably be "delete-modal-cancel".

So I'll add these attributes to each button in the component. This way, when the test runs and tries to find those data-testid names, they will exist on their respective elements.

I need to make sure that each button is updated correctly without introducing any syntax errors or breaking other parts of the code.

To fix the issue where the test expects missing `data-testid` attributes in the component, we'll add these attributes to the relevant buttons. The delete confirm button should have `delete-modal-confirm`, and the cancel button should have `delete-modal-cancel`.
