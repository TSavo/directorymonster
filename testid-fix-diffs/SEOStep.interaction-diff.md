Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this mismatch between the test and the component. The user mentioned that there are missing data-testid attributes in the SEOStep component: meta-title-input and noindex-checkbox. Looking at the test file, it seems like these attributes were used to find elements which aren't present in the component.

First, I need to check where these data-testid values are supposed to come from. In the test setup, there's a mock for SEOSettings that includes a function onSeoChange. When the user types into the input or clicks the checkbox, it triggers this callback with updated SEO data.

In the component, SEOStep.tsx, I see that it's wrapping the SEOSettings component but doesn't add any new elements or handlers for these specific inputs. So the component isn't rendering these input fields at all. That explains why the test is looking for non-existent attributesâ€”they're not part of the component's structure.

To fix this, I should update the SEOStep component to include these missing input fields with their respective data-testid attributes. The test expects these elements because they are present in the rendered UI when the user interacts with them.

So, I'll add two state variables for metaTitle and noindex in the SEOStepProps interface. Then, inside the return statement of SEOStep, I'll include an input element for meta-title with data-testid="meta-title-input" and bind it to metaTitle. Similarly, I'll add a checkbox for noindex with data-testid="noindex-checkbox".

By doing this, both elements will be rendered in the component, allowing the test to find them using their respective data-testid attributes without needing any mock changes. This should make the test pass as intended.

I also need to ensure that the values from the initialData prop are correctly set for these new fields so that when onSeoChange is called, it updates accordingly.

To fix the mismatch between the component and test, we need to add the missing data-testid attributes to the SEOStep component. The input field for meta title and checkbox for noindex should be included in the component.

Here's the diff adding these elements:
