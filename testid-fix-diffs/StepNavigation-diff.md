<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the tests are failing for the StepNavigation component. The error says that there are missing data-testid attributes in both the test and the component.

Looking at the test file, it imports the StepNavigation component with some steps, currentStep set to 'basic-info', completedSteps empty, and onStepChange as a mock function. Then it renders the component and checks for specific data-testid attributes like 'step-button-basic-info' etc., which don't exist in the component yet.

In the component file, each step button has a data-testid attribute called data-testid="step-item-${step.id}". But wait, that's actually inside a li tag as data-testid. The test is looking for 'step-button-' plus the step id, so maybe the component isn't assigning those correctly.

I think in React components, buttons often use data-testid attributes on their parent elements to target them via screen selection libraries like Accessibility Enhancer or ARIA. So perhaps each button should have a data-testid attribute pointing directly to 'step-button-' + step.id instead of being inside an li with the same name.

So I need to modify the component to add data-testid="step-button-${step.id}" on the button elements. That way, when the test runs, it can find them correctly.

Let me look at the current code in StepNavigation.tsx. The buttons are created within a loop over steps.map(), and each button has className with some styles but no data-testid yet. So I'll add a data-testid prop to each button element.

I should create a diff that adds this attribute for each button, replacing or updating the existing one. That way, when the test runs, it can find those data-testid attributes as expected.

To fix the mismatched `data-testid` attributes between the component and tests, we need to update the `StepNavigation` component to include the correct `data-testid` values for each step button.

**Changes Made:**
1. Updated the `Button` in `StepNavigation.tsx` to use the appropriate `data-testid` attribute with the format `step-button-${step.id}` as expected by the tests.
