Alright, I'm trying to help fix this issue where the tests are failing because they're looking for data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component. Let me think through what needs to be done.

First, I look at the test file. The test is expecting three data-testid attributes: admin-access, editor-access, and viewer-access. But when I check the component (index.ts), there's no mention of these data-testid attributes. So the problem is that the component isn't generating these attributes, which is why the tests are failing.

I remember that in React components, sometimes you can add event listeners or use other hooks to generate these attributes dynamically. Since the tests are expecting these data-testid values, I need to make sure the component actually emits them when render is called.

Looking at the RoleTestComponent, it's a simple component that returns JSX elements but doesn't have any data-testid set. So, I'll need to add an event listener or some logic inside this component that listens for certain events and then sets these data-testid attributes on the DOM elements.

I think adding an Intersection Observer might be a good approach here. This observer can detect when specific elements come into view and then call a function to set the data-testid attribute accordingly based on the user's role, which is determined by the useAuth hook.

So, I'll modify the RoleTestComponent to include this logic. The plan is:

1. Import IntersectionObserver from 'react-dom'.
2. Inside the component, define an observe function that will update the DOM elements.
3. Use useEffect to trigger the observation when render is called.
4. In the observe function, check if the element is in focus or has a certain class and then set the appropriate data-testid attribute.

I'll add this code right after the return statement so it's part of the component structure. This should generate all three data-testid attributes as expected by the test.

Now, testing: After making these changes, running the tests should pass because the component will now have the required attributes with the correct values based on the user's role.
</think>

To fix this issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the component. The RoleTestComponent does not currently generate these attributes, which is causing the test failures.

We'll modify the RoleTestComponent to dynamically set these attributes using a combination of Intersection Observer and useEffect hooks.

```

This change adds an Intersection Observer to listen for focus events on the DOM elements. When a focus event is detected and if the element has a `data-testid` attribute, it determines the user's role from `useAuth` and sets the appropriate `data-testid` value.
