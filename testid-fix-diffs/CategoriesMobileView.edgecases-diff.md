<think>
Okay, I'm looking at this problem where a test is failing because the component doesn't have some missing data-testid attributes. The test is checking for specific attributes like category-card-category_1 and others that aren't present in the component. 

First, I need to understand why these attributes are missing. Maybe when the categories list changes dynamically, new elements are created without updating all necessary UI properties.

Looking at the test code, it's rendering a CategoriesMobileView component with changing categories. The failing assertions suggest that some elements related to category cards aren't being rendered correctly after dynamic updates.

I check the component file provided. The issue is that certain data-testid attributes aren't defined in the component. These attributes are expected by the test but don't exist, causing failures.

To fix this, I should either add these data-testid attributes to the component or update the test to use existing ones. But since the component's structure might require new elements when categories change, adding the missing attributes seems appropriate.

I'll need to add each missing attribute in their respective sections within the component. This ensures that when a category is added or removed, all necessary UI updates happen correctly.

So, I'll locate where these elements are created and add lines for each data-testid. Each line will assign an ID based on the new attributes mentioned.

To fix the issue with missing data-testid attributes in the test, we need to update the component's structure to include these attributes when categories are added or removed.

This diff adds the missing `data-testid` attributes to both the main category cards and their child elements, ensuring that all dynamically created nodes have appropriate visual updates.
