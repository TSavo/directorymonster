Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the mismatched data-testid attributes between the React component and its test file. The test is looking for 'security-indicator', 'login-loading-indicator', and 'login-error-message' which aren't present in the component.

First, I should check what elements are actually present in the ZKPLogin component. Since the test expects these specific data-testid attributes, maybe the component isn't using them or they're not set correctly.

Looking at the test file, it's expecting these elements to be present with certain classes. So perhaps the component doesn't have these attributes defined. The solution would involve adding these data-testid attributes to the component so that the test can find them.

I'll need to locate where in the ZKPLoginComponent these attributes should be placed. They could be on buttons, checkboxes, or other elements within the component. Each element needs its own data-testid attribute with the correct name and value.

For example, if there's a security indicator button, it should have 'security-indicator' as its data-testid. Similarly, any loading indicators and error messages should also have their respective attributes.

So, I'll update the ZKPLoginComponent to include these attributes on the relevant elements. This way, when the test runs, it can find them without issues.

To fix the missing data-testid attributes in the component, we need to add `security-indicator`, `login-loading-indicator`, and `login-error-message` to the ZKPLogin component.

Here's the change:

1. First, locate the elements that should have these data-testid attributes:
   - Add security-indicator to a security indicator button
   - Add login_loading_indicator to the loading state button
   - Add login_error_message to the error message text

This adds the required data-testid attributes to match what's expected by the test.
