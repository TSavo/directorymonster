Okay, so I've got this problem where a React component is missing some data-testid attributes that the test expects. The specific issue is that there's a data-testid called "siteForm-submit" which doesn't exist in the component. My task is to figure out how to fix this by either adding the missing attributes or adjusting the test.

First, I need to understand where these data-testid values are used. Looking at the code, I see that the form submission is handled in the handleSiteFormSubmit function. This suggests that when the user submits the form, React should emit an action event with a data-testid attribute set to "siteForm-submit". That makes sense because it tells other components or parts of the app what kind of event this is.

So, I need to add this data-testid to the component so that React can properly handle the submission. The best place to do this would be where the form is renderedâ€”in the <form> tag. Adding a data-testid attribute there will apply it whenever the form is submitted.

Next, I should check if any other parts of the component are affected by these missing attributes. For example, in the StepNavigation or FormActions components, they might rely on certain data-testid values to work correctly. But since the immediate issue is that the test expects "siteForm-submit" and it's not there, adding this attribute should resolve the problem.

I also need to make sure that any other parts of the component using these attributes are updated, but based on the given code, those seem to be properly handled elsewhere. So, adding data-testid="siteForm-submit" to the form tag should suffice.
</think>

To fix the issue where the test expects a missing `data-testid` attribute "siteForm-submit", we need to add this attribute to the component.

The submission handler is used when the form is submitted via button click or other triggers. Adding the data-testid="siteForm-submit" will properly emit an action event when the form is submitted, which should satisfy both the test and any consuming components that expect this event type.
