Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the issue where the test is looking for missing data-testid attributes in the component. The problem is that the component doesn't have these attributes defined, so the test fails.

Looking at the test code, it seems like several elements are being clicked, each with a specific data-testid attribute. These include category-card, view, edit, and delete buttons for different categories.

First, I should check if these data-testid attributes exist in the component's JSX. If they don't, the component needs to have corresponding divs or buttons that receive these attributes.

In the CategoriesMobileView component, I'll look at each of these elements:

1. category-card: There might be a div with this class where a button is placed. So adding data-testid="category-card" makes sense.
2. view-button: This should be straightforward by adding it as a button with the appropriate class and data-testid.
3. edit-button: Similarly, an input or button element with data-testid="edit-button".
4. delete-button: For each category, there should be a delete button with the correct data-testid.

I'll add these divs or buttons in the component's JSX. Each will have the necessary data-testid attribute as specified by the test cases.

Now, I need to update the component file (src\components\admin\categories\components\index.ts) by adding these new elements with their respective attributes. This should provide the required data-testid properties that the test is expecting.
</think>

To resolve the missing data-testid attributes issue, we'll add corresponding div elements with data-testid attributes in the CategoriesMobileView component.
