Alright, I need to figure out how to fix the mismatched data-testid attributes between the React component and its test file. The test is looking for 'auth-status', 'username', and 'role' data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component. 

First, I'll check the component file. In the index.ts, under the useAuth hook, it returns user with role and username. But where are these displayed? Looking at the TestAuthConsumer in the test, it uses these data-testid attributes to render elements.

In the test, when the component is rendered, it expects these data-testid attributes to be present on specific elements. However, if the component doesn't have these attributes added yet, the test fails because they're missing.

So, I should add these data-testid attributes to the component's JSX so that the browser includes them in the DOM, which will make the test pass since those attributes are now present.

I'll locate where user information is displayed. Probably in the ZKPLogin or FirstUserSetup components. Adding these data-testid attributes there would ensure they're available when rendered.

Let me find a suitable place to add them. In the ZKPLoginComponent, which might be used for displaying login details, I can add a div with content that includes the username and role as child elements under a #zkp-login element. This way, setting data-testid="login-info" on that div will include those attributes.

By adding these attributes to the correct component, when TestAuthConsumer renders it, these attributes will be present, matching what the test expects. Thus, the test should no longer fail due to missing data-testid attributes.
</think>

To fix the issue where the test is looking for `auth-status`, `username`, and `role` data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component, we need to add these data-testid attributes to an appropriate element in the component.

This change adds the required data-testid attributes to a `login-info` div element in the ZKPLogin component. The test should now pass since the necessary attributes are present.

Note: If you're using these attributes elsewhere, make sure they match exactly with what's expected by your test cases.
