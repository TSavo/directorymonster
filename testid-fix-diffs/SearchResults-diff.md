<think>
Okay, I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is looking for data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component. The problem statement says that the test expects 'mock-search-filters' and 'filter-category-button', but these aren't present.

First, I need to look at where these data-testid values are supposed to come from. Since they're not in the component, perhaps they should be added there. 

Looking at the provided code, it's a React functional component rendering search results along with filters. The test is likely checking for elements related to search filters.

I notice that the component has a state variable called 'filters' which might correspond to the mock-search-filters data-testid. So I can add an attribute like data-testid="mock-search-filters" to the <div> element where the filters are rendered.

For filter-category-button, it's probably a button within the filters section. I'll need to find that specific button and add the data-testid attribute there.

I should make sure these attributes are added correctly without disrupting the existing functionality. Testing after this change would confirm if the issue is resolved.
</think>

To resolve the missing data-testid attributes in the component, we've identified that:
1. The filters container needs a `mock-search-filters` data-testid
2. The "Filter Categories" button should have `filter-category-button`
