Alright, so I have this problem where my React component isn't matching up with the test cases because of missing data-testid attributes. The test is looking for 'test-title', 'test-button', and 'test-description' but the component doesn't have these set. Let me figure out how to fix this.

First, I need to understand what each test expects. In the first test, it's rendering the component with title and description, then using expect().toBeInTheDocument() on the returned string. But instead of using data-testid attributes, it's directly checking for text content. That makes sense because sometimes text might change but the data-testid stays.

Looking at the component, I don't see any data-testid set on the elements. So when the test tries to get 'test-title', there's nothing there. The same applies to 'test-button' and 'test-description'.

So, one approach is to add these data-testid attributes to both the title-element, button, and description in the component. This way, the test can find them using screen.getByTestId().

Alternatively, maybe the tests are trying to get the wrong attributes. But since the test expects 'test-title' which corresponds to the title element, adding it makes sense.

I should check if the button has a data-testid. In the test, they're expecting 'test-button', so I'll add that as well. And for the description, perhaps it's better to use a data-testid like 'test-description' since it's text content can change but the data-testid remains consistent.

So, in the component, I'll modify each element:

1. The h2 tag will have data-testid="test-title".
2. The button will have data-testid="test-button".
3. The p tag (which contains the description) will have data-testid="test-description".

I think that should make the tests pass because now when the test looks for these data-testid attributes, they'll find them in the component.

Let me write out the diff to reflect these changes.

To resolve the mismatched data-testid issues between the component and tests, we need to add appropriate data-testid attributes to key elements in `TestComponent.tsx`. Specifically:

1. Add `data-testid="test-title"` to the `<h2>` element.
2. Add `data-testid="test-button"` to the button element.
3. Add `data-testid="test-description"` to the `<p>` element containing the description.
