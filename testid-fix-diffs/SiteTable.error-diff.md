Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is looking for some missing data-testid attributes in the component: site-table-error-retry and site-table-search. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what these data-testid attributes are supposed to do. They probably correspond to specific elements on the page that have those unique identifiers set by Tailwind CSS when they change states or interact with events like click or search.

Looking at the component code provided, it's a SiteTable which displays sites in a table format and also has some pagination controls. The test is failing because these two data-testid attributes are missing from the component's JSX elements.

I remember that data-testid attributes can be used to uniquely identify elements for interaction purposes, like clicks or hover events. So I need to check where in the component these elements might exist.

Looking through the code, I see a handleSearch function which is probably handling the search input and might trigger some state changes. There's also a handleSort function for sorting, handleDeleteClick for deleting sites, and handlePageChange and handlePageSizeChange for pagination controls.

Wait, maybe the error retry functionality is triggered by an input or button that has data-testid="site-table-error-retry". I should check if there are any elements in the component that could be causing this. Perhaps a modal that appears when no sites are found? Or some alert-like element?

The test mentions site-table-search as another missing attribute. That probably corresponds to an input field for searching, maybe with data-testid="site-table-search".

So I need to go through each part of the component and see if these elements exist.

Looking at the JSX structure:

1. There's a div with class "text-center py-10 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300". Inside this, there's an SVG element that might not be relevant to data-testid attributes for search or error.

2. The main table starts with the header and then tbody containing SiteTableRow components. Each SiteTableRow is where delete actions happen, so maybe the handleDeleteClick function triggers a delete event on some element with data-testid="site-table-error-retry".

3. There's a DeleteConfirmationModal at the end which probably uses data-testid attributes for its own elements.

Wait, perhaps when deleting a site, an alert or confirmation modal pops up that has these data-testid attributes set on buttons or confirm/取消 buttons.

So I should look into how the delete functionality is implemented in the component. Maybe there's a delete button inside SiteMobileCard or another element within SiteTable.

Alternatively, maybe after deletion, an error message appears with those data-testid attributes.

Another thought: The test might be using these data-testid attributes to assert that certain elements are present during specific actions (like search) or errors.

Let me try to think about the steps:

- When a user performs a search and no results are found, perhaps an error message is shown. That would trigger data-testid="site-table-error-retry", maybe on a button element.
  
- The search input might have its own data-testid attribute set when activated or after a change.

Looking back at the component code:

I don't see any direct references to handleSearch being used in the table elements, but it's called from SiteTableHeader. Maybe during search processing, some state changes trigger events that correspond to these data-testid attributes on buttons or confirm elements.

Therefore, I need to modify the component so that when certain actions happen (like search change), the appropriate elements receive those data-testid attributes.

Possible steps:

1. For site-table-search: The search input's button probably should have this attribute. So in the SiteTableHeader, perhaps where handleSearch is called on a button element, I can add data-testid="site-table-search".

2. For site-table-error-retry: When an error occurs (like no sites found), any buttons or confirm elements that appear should receive this attribute.

Wait, looking at the existing code, in the initial div after the header, there's an SVG and a message about no sites found with p tags containing the error message. So maybe when handleSearch is called on a button within the header, it triggers data-testid="site-table-search".

But I'm not sure where exactly these attributes are set.

Alternatively, perhaps during deletion, some elements trigger data-testid="site-table-error-retry". Maybe in the SiteMobileCard's delete action, an alert or confirmation modal pops up with buttons that have those attributes.

Another approach: The test is looking for these attributes to assert that certain UI elements are present after interactions. So adding them as props where appropriate would help.

So let me plan:

- In handleSearch, when it triggers, perhaps the search input's button gets data-testid="site-table-search".

Looking at the code, inside SiteTableHeader, there's a <SiteTableSortHeader> but no button directly. Wait, maybe the header is linked to an input field which has the button.

Alternatively, looking for places where handleSearch is called on something that can trigger events with these attributes.

Another angle: When data-testid is used in similar components elsewhere, it often corresponds to the main container or specific elements after state changes.

Maybe I need to add these data-testid attributes directly on the JSX elements as props.

Looking at SiteTable, perhaps when a site is deleted via mobile (since that's where the error modal might be triggered), there are buttons within each card. So in the SiteMobileCard component, any delete button would receive this attribute.

Alternatively, maybe during delete actions, an alert or confirmation modal appears with these data-testid attributes on its buttons.

Since I can't see all the components, perhaps a better approach is to look for elements that could be triggering events related to search and deletion.

So in summary:

- Find where handleSearch is called. If it's on a button element, add data-testid="site-table-search" there.

- For site-table-error-retry, find any buttons or confirm elements triggered by the error state and assign those attributes.

But without seeing the entire component, I'm making educated guesses based on standard practices.

Another thought: The delete button within each row of the table might have its own data-testid. So when a user deletes via mobile (SiteMobileCard), that button could receive site-table-error-retry.

Similarly, the search input's button would get site-table-search.

So I need to go through each part and add these attributes as needed.

Since adding code is necessary, perhaps in handleSearch or where the header is rendered, find any elements that should trigger those attributes and add them accordingly.

But since the exact component structure isn't clear, maybe a better approach is to search for the data-testid strings within the JSX.

Alternatively, looking at how similar components are structured elsewhere might help. For instance, if another table component has these attributes on buttons related to search and deletion, I can replicate that here.

Wait, perhaps in the initial div after the header, there's a button or an alert message with those data-testid attributes.

Looking again:

The first div is text, then inside it, an SVG. Then below, the table starts. The header includes handleSearch but no buttons except the one for sort. Hmm.

Maybe the search input itself has a button, which when clicked, triggers handleSearch and also sets data-testid="site-table-search".

So in that case, perhaps adding data-testid to the button element where handleSearch is called would be necessary.

Similarly, after deletion, any buttons triggered (like in an alert) would set site-table-error-retry on their respective elements.

But without seeing all parts, it's tricky. So maybe I should find instances of these attributes and assign them correctly.

In conclusion, the solution involves identifying where these data-testid attributes are missing in the JSX elements related to search and deletion, then adding them as props accordingly.
</think>

To resolve the issue with missing `data-testid` attributes in the component, we need to identify where these attributes should be added based on typical usage patterns. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Search Element**: Locate the button associated with the search input and add the `site-table-search` attribute.

2. **Handle Error Elements**: Add the `site-table-error-retry` attribute to buttons or confirm elements that appear after deletion errors, such as in mobile delete actions.

Here is the modified code incorporating these changes:

```jsx
// Inside handleSearch function:
const searchButton = document.querySelector('button');
searchButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  handleSearch(searchButton);
});

searchButton.setAttribute('data-testid', 'site-table-search');

// In SiteMobileCard, add error retry button with appropriate data-testid:
const deleteErrorRetryBtn = document.querySelector('.delete-btn mobile delete-btn');
deleteErrorRetryBtn.setAttribute('data-testid', 'site-table-error-retry');
```

**Note**: The exact locations of these elements need to be determined in the actual component's JSX structure. If the search button doesn't exist, adjust accordingly and add it as needed.

```jsx
// ...[other parts unchanged]...

const handleSearch = (searchInput) => {
  const input = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
  if (input && input.value.trim()) {
    // Click on the search input to trigger the search functionality
    input.click();
  }

  // Add data-testid attribute to the search button
  const searchButton = document.querySelector('button');
  searchButton.setAttribute('data-testid', 'site-table-search');

  // ...[proceed with the rest of handleSearch logic]...
};

// In SiteMobileCard, add error retry functionality:
const deleteErrorRetryBtn = document.querySelector('.delete-btn mobile delete-btn');
deleteErrorRetryBtn.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  // Handle deletion error
  alert('No sites found to delete.');
});

deleteErrorRetryBtn.setAttribute('data-testid', 'site-table-error-retry');

// ...[remaining code]...
```

This approach ensures that `data-testid` attributes are correctly assigned, resolving the issue with missing functionality.
