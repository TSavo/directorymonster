<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user is getting an error because their test expects certain data-testid attributes that aren't present in their component. Specifically, they're missing "protected-content" and "custom-loader". 

First, I need to understand where these data-testid values are coming from. Typically, data-testid is used in React components to attach a unique identifier for accessibility features or specific testing frameworks like Jest. Since the test expects these attributes, it's likely trying to render certain elements based on them.

Looking at the component provided, it doesn't have any JSX elements with these data-testid attributes. So, maybe the component isn't rendering some parts that rely on these attributes. For example, perhaps there are conditional renders or specific UI elements that only show up when certain data-testid values are set.

I need to check if these attributes are necessary for the functionality of the component and why they're missing. If they aren't used in any part of the component's rendering logic, maybe removing them would fix the test without affecting anything else. Alternatively, if the component is supposed to have some elements that require these data-testid values, I'd need to add them.

Since adding might be necessary but only for specific cases, perhaps wrapping some parts of the JSX with a conditional render using data-testid could be a solution. For instance, rendering an element and then checking if "protected-content" or "custom-loader" is present before displaying it.

So, the plan is to modify the component by wrapping relevant JSX elements with ` {/* {data-testid = '...'} */ }` inside curly braces and conditionally render them based on whether those attributes exist. This way, any dependent parts of the UI can be rendered only when required, fixing the test without introducing unnecessary data.

Finally, I'll structure this change using a git diff format, focusing on adding these conditional renders where necessary to ensure all dependencies are correctly handled.
