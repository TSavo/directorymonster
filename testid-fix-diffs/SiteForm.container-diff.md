Okay, so I have this problem where a test is failing because it can't find some data-testid attributes in the SiteForm component. The missing ones are basic-info-step, domain-step, and site-form-preview. Hmm, let me think about what's going on here.

Looking at the code provided, I see that the SiteForm component renders several steps like BasicInfoStep, DomainStep, etc., each with their own data-testid attributes. But wait, in the JSX, those steps are being rendered without specifying a data-testid prop. That might be the issue because the test is looking for these specific attributes.

So, maybe the problem is that the SiteForm component isn't assigning the correct data-testid to each step element. The test probably mocks certain elements and expects them to have these attributes. Without setting them, those mocks aren't being used correctly.

Looking at the structure of the JSX in SiteForm.tsx, I see that after the steps are rendered, there's a FormActions component which also has some data-testid props. So perhaps each step element (like BasicInfoStep) should be wrapped inside a div or another container that has the appropriate data-testid attribute set.

Alternatively, maybe each StepContent component is being used with a data-testid prop. But in the current code, I don't see any such wrapper. So adding data-testid="basic-info-step" to each step's wrapper might solve the issue.

Wait, looking closer, after each activeStep condition, there's an opening div with data-testid="step-content". Maybe that's where we should add the specific data-testid attributes for each step type.

So, perhaps inside that div, I can create a nested div or another element and set its data-testid to basic-info-step, domain-step, etc., depending on which activeStep is being used. Then, wrap the StepContent component inside this new div so it inherits the data-testid.

That way, when the test expects elements with those specific attributes, they will be present because each step's rendering area now has the correct data-testid set.

So I'll modify the JSX to add a nested div for each activeStep case and assign the corresponding data-testid. That should make the mocks in the test recognize these steps correctly.
</think>

To resolve the issue with missing `data-testid` attributes, we need to ensure that each step's rendering area has the appropriate `data-testid` attribute set.

This change adds the `data-testid` attribute to each step's rendering context, ensuring that all steps are properly recognized and tested.
