Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is failing because it can't find the 'pagination-next' and 'pagination-previous' data-testid attributes in my component. Let me start by looking at what the problem could be.

First, I remember that data-testid is a React attribute used to reference an external element, usually from a library or another component, so that other parts of the app can listen for events on it. The test must be trying to find these specific elements but they're missing in my current code.

Looking at the provided code, I see that there are buttons with classes like 'px-3 py-1 rounded' and some have data-testid attributes. Specifically, the previous and next page buttons use 'data-testid="previous-page-button"' and 'data-testid="next-page-button"', but not 'pagination-previous' or 'pagination-next'. 

Wait, maybe that's the issueâ€”the test is looking for 'pagination-previous' and 'pagination-next', which aren't present in my component. So perhaps I need to add these data-testid attributes to the buttons so that other parts of the application can find them.

Alternatively, if those are not existing elsewhere, maybe the test should be updated instead. But since the user prefers adding the missing attributes to the component (the preferred approach), I'll go with that.

So, I need to modify the previous and next buttons to include 'data-testid="pagination-previous"' and 'data-testid="pagination-next"', respectively. Let me check where these buttons are in the code. They're inside the pagination controls section of the component.

I'll update each button by adding the appropriate data-testid attribute. That should make the test pass because now the data is available to listen for events on those elements.
</think>

To resolve the issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the previous and next page buttons in the pagination controls section of the component.
