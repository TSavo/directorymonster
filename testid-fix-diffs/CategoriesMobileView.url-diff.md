Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this test where certain data-testid attributes aren't being found in the component. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the test provided, it expects several elements like 'view-link-category_1', 'edit-link-category_1', etc., but these aren't present in the component. That means either the component isn't rendering these links or they're not being properly marked with data-testid attributes.

The test is using a mobile view component for categories. It's creating two categories: one with an empty slug and another with null slug. The test then checks if there are links to these categories, expecting specific hrefs. But in the component, maybe these links aren't present or not tagged correctly with data-testid attributes.

Looking at the component file (index.ts), it exports various parts like CategoriesMobileView. I don't see any lines adding data-testid attributes for those expected elements here. So perhaps the issue is that the component isn't generating the necessary HTML elements, which would naturally have these data-testid attributes.

In the test case, when render() is called with categories={emptySlugCategories}, it's passing showSiteColumn as false and other modifiers. Maybe without showSiteColumn being true, some of the links aren't rendered because they're collapsed or not included in the list.

So I think two changes might be needed:

1. Ensure that the component correctly renders all the necessary category links when showSiteColumn is false. Perhaps by adding them explicitly to avoid relying on a default behavior that's missing here.

2. Add data-testid attributes to these new elements so the test can find them. Without those, the test fails because it expects those attributes to exist for the links.

I'm not entirely sure how the component handles category rendering when showSiteColumn is false, but if adding explicit links would help, that might resolve part of the issue. Also, updating the tests to expect these new data-testid attributes makes sense.
</think>

To fix the test, we need to add `data-testid` attributes for the missing elements in the component.

This change adds the missing category link elements with their respective `data-testid` attributes, allowing the test to find them.
