Okay, so I have this problem where a test is failing because it can't find some data-testid attributes in the component: 'protected-content' and 'custom-fallback'. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that data-testid is an attribute used in React components to provide accessibility identifiers. So if the test is looking for these attributes but they don't exist in the component, either the component isn't using them or they're named differently.

Looking at the code provided, it's a functional component written with React and TypeScript. The component uses hooks like useEffect, const, and useCallback, which are all standard for React components.

The issue is that the test expects these data-testid attributes to be present on certain elements but isn't finding them. So maybe those elements don't have them yet or they're named differently in the component's JSX.

I need to decide whether to add the missing attributes to the component or update the test. Since adding might fix it, I'll consider that first.

Looking at typical React components, buttons often use data-testid="btn" as an example. So if the component has elements like buttons that should have these attributes, they probably don't have them yet.

Wait, but in the provided code, there's a part where setAuthState is called with isLoading: true. Maybe those elements are conditionally rendered based on isLoading, so perhaps adding data-testid would help with accessibility when isLoading is true.

Alternatively, maybe the test is using mocks that expect these attributes to exist on certain event handlers or DOM elements. So if I don't add them to the component's children, the mock might fail because it expects them.

So to fix this, I should check which elements in the component need these data-testid attributes and add them accordingly.

But since the exact components aren't provided here, maybe a safer approach is to update the test to use existing attributes instead. However, without seeing the test code, it's hard to say exactly what to change.

Alternatively, perhaps the test expects these attributes on certain elements that are dynamically added or removed based on hasPermission function in the component. Maybe those elements (like buttons) don't have data-testid set yet.

In any case, adding the missing attributes where they're expected would likely resolve the issue. For example, if there's an input or button element that should have these attributes when isLoading is true, I can add them conditionally based on the state.

So in the component, wherever isLoading is true and those elements are rendered, I'll include data-testid with appropriate values like "input-field" or "btn".

Alternatively, perhaps the test is looking for these attributes on the event handlers passed to onClick, but that's less likely. More common would be attaching them to DOM nodes.

So without more context, adding data-testid="something" where necessary in the JSX elements should fix the issue.
</think>

To resolve the issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the component where they are expected by the test. Here's how:

1. **Identify Where Data-testid is Expected:** Since the test expects these attributes but they don't exist, determine which JSX elements in the component should have them based on the test's expectations.

2. **Modify Component JSX Elements:** Add `data-testid` attributes to those elements. For example:
   - Buttons
   - Input fields

Here is a hypothetical modification (assuming buttons are involved):

```diff

   },

```

**Note:** Replace the specific elements and attributes with those relevant to your component. The key is to add `data-testid` where the test expects it based on the element types involved in loading or unloading states.
