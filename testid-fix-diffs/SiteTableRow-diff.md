Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is looking for some data-testid attributes that don't exist in the component. The problem seems to be that when running the test, it expects certain dynamic attributes like site-name-site-123 and others, but those aren't present in the component's code.

First, I look at the provided code of the SiteTableRow component. There are links and buttons with data-testid properties. But none of them have the ones mentioned: site-name-site-123, site-slug-site-123, etc. So that's why the test is failingâ€”they're expecting those attributes to exist.

I need to figure out where these attributes should come from in the component. Since they are data-testid attributes, each element (like a link or button) must have this attribute set to the unique identifier used in the test for that specific case.

For the site name, maybe it's linked to a <div> with an id like "site-name-site-123". Similarly, the slug might be another div. The domains could be part of another element. For the edit and delete buttons, perhaps each button is assigned a unique data-testid when they're created.

So the solution would involve adding these missing attributes to their respective elements in the component's JSX. Each link or button should have its data-testid set to match what the test expects.

I'll go through each of the mentioned attributes:

1. **site-name-site-123**: Find where the site name is displayed and add it as a link with data-testid.
2. **site-slug-site-123**: Do the same for the slug, maybe another link or div.
3. **site-domains-site-123**: This might require an anchor tag inside the site element, so I'll set its data-testid accordingly.
4. **site-edit-button-site-123 and site-delete-button-site-123**: These buttons probably need their own data-testid attributes added.

I should check each part of the code to find where these elements are located and add the necessary attributes. For example, if the site name is a <a> tag, I'll set its href and data-testid. Similarly for the slug and domains.

Once all the missing attributes are added with their corresponding values, the test should pass because it will now find those attributes as expected.
</think>

To fix this issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the component elements that correspond to these properties in the test. Here's how:

1. Add `site-name-site-123` as a `data-testid` attribute on the site name link.
2. Add `site-slug-site-123` as a `data-testid` attribute on the slug element.
3. Add `site-domains-site-123` as a `data-testid` attribute on the domains anchor tag.
4. Add appropriate `data-testid` attributes to both edit and delete buttons.
