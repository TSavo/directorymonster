Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to fix this mismatch between the test and the component. The test is expecting certain data-testid attributes that aren't present in the component yet.

Looking at the test file, it uses screen.getByTestId for different inputs like 'site-form-name', 'site-form-slug', and 'site-form-description'. That means the test expects these elements to have specific data-testid names. However, when I check the component, those fields don't seem to have data-testid attributes defined.

So, the problem is that the component doesn't have data-testid attributes for each input field, which is why the test can't find them. To fix this, I need to add these attributes to each of the input elements in the component so they match what the test is expecting.

First, I'll look at where the inputs are defined in the component. The name input has an onChange handler but no data-testid. Similarly for slug and description. For each input, I'll add a data-testid attribute with the corresponding test's id: 'siteForm-name', 'siteForm-slug', and 'siteForm-description' respectively.

I should also make sure that these attributes are placed correctly in the code to match how the test is referencing them. This way, when the test runs, it can find the elements using those data-testid names without any issues.

So, I'll add each data-testid attribute right after each input's name prop in their respective sections within the component.

To resolve the mismatch between the test and component, we need to add `data-testid` attributes matching what the test expects. These should be added on the corresponding input fields:
- Input field for Name
- Input field for Slug
- Input field for Description
