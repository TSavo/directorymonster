Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to fix this issue where the test is looking for some missing data-testid attributes in the component. The problem is that the component doesn't have these attributes, which are expected by the test.

First, I need to understand what the test is expecting. It mentions data-testid attributes like 'login-loading-indicator'. These are usually used in React components to identify specific elements for mocks or testing purposes.

Looking at the provided files, there's a RoleGuard component and others related to authentication, but no mention of any loading indicators or similar elements that would have these data-testid attributes. So I need to add these attributes to the component so that the test can find them.

I should check which parts of the component might be causing this issue. The test is probably trying to attach a mock element with specific data-testid properties, expecting it to exist in the component's JSX tree. Without these attributes, the mock setup fails because the component doesn't have those elements defined.

So the solution would involve adding new div or button elements that include the necessary data-testid attributes. Each of these should be placed where appropriate in the component's structure. For example, if a loading indicator is needed, maybe I can add a div with id="loading-indicator" and include the data-testid attribute pointing to 'login-loading-indicator' along with other necessary props.

I need to make sure that each new element added has all the required attributes, including the data-testid ones. Also, considering the existing code structure, perhaps adding these elements after the main content or before it would be appropriate.

Another consideration is whether multiple such attributes are needed for different parts of the component. If so, I'll need to add them accordingly without disrupting the component's functionality.

Finally, once these changes are made, the test should correctly find the data-testid attributes because they're now present in the component as expected.

To fix the issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the component. Based on the test requirements, a loading indicator is needed with specific attributes.
