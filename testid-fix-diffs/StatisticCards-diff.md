Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where a test is failing because it can't find some data-testid attributes in the component: statistic-card-title, statistic-card-skeleton, and metrics-error. The user provided the code for the StatisticCards component and mentioned that the test expects these attributes.

First, I need to figure out what each of these attributes does. Data-testid is a React API used to simulate mouse events on DOM elements. So, if the test is trying to click or interact with these components using the data-testid prop, those attributes must be correctly assigned in the component's JSX.

Looking at the provided code, I see that some parts use className and other props for styling, but none of them have a data-testid attribute. That means the current implementation isn't providing any interactivity beyond what React might default to, which is not enough for the test to pass because it expects these specific events.

So, the solution should involve adding the data-testid attributes where needed. The test likely clicks on each statistic card or metrics error element, expecting certain behavior based on these interactions.

I'll need to identify which elements in the component require a data-testid attribute. For example, if a button exists that triggers an action when clicked via a data-testid, I should add data-testid="button" to it. Similarly, for any error messages (like MetricsError), I should include the appropriate data-testid attributes.

Since each of these statistics cards might be clickable elements with their own data-testid attributes, I'll go through each statistic card and ensure they have a data-testid prop pointing to the correct class or id as used in the test. This way, when the test simulates a mouse event on those elements, React will correctly apply the data-testid, making the test pass.

I should also check if there are any additional attributes like metrics-error, which might be applied to specific components (like MetricsError) within theStatisticsContainer. Adding these attributes would ensure that any error handling or events in the component work as expected according to the test.

In summary, I need to add data-testid and other related attributes to each clickable element in the StatisticCards component so that the corresponding tests can simulate mouse events correctly.

This change adds the `data-testid` attribute to each statistic card and metrics error component. This will allow the test to properly simulate mouse events on these components.

Note: The specific class names for the data-testid attributes should be adjusted based on how your test is set up, but this provides a starting point in the correct format for React's data-testid prop.
