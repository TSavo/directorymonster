Alright, I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is failing because it can't find some data-testid attributes in the SEOStep component. Let me look at what's going on.

First, looking at the test file, it's expecting several data-testid attributes like 'seo-settings', 'seo-step-heading', and others that aren't present in the component. So the problem is that either the component doesn't have these attributes defined or the test is using outdated ones.

I check the SEOStep.tsx component. It wraps the SEOSettings component but I don't see any data-testid attributes declared there. The test, however, is looking for these attributes on the rendered component. Since the test was working before, maybe the component's structure has changed in a way that the data-testid mappings are now different.

I think the solution might be to update the component to include these missing data-testid attributes. Let me list them again: 'seo-settings', 'seo-step-heading', 'seo-step-description', 'meta-title-input', 'meta-description-input', 'noindex-checkbox', and their error counterparts.

Wait, in the current SEOStep.tsx, it's returning the SEOSettings component directly without any additional wrapping. So maybe I need to add these data-testid attributes to the returned component so that they're correctly mapped when rendered.

Alternatively, perhaps the test is using mocks for these attributes because the component doesn't expose them. Looking at the test file, there are already some mocks in place. Maybe adding these attributes with appropriate default values would help.

So I'll go ahead and modify the SEOStep component to include all the missing data-testid attributes. Each input or element should have a corresponding data-testid attribute set so that they're correctly picked up by React Testing Library's mock framework.

I'll add each of these attributes inside the returned JSX, right after wrapping the SEOSettings component. This way, when the test runs, it can find and mock these attributes without issues.

Let me outline what needs to be added:

- The 'seo-settings' data-testid for the outer div.
- 'seo-step-heading' and 'seo-step-description' as headings inside that div.
- Each input field in SEOSettings should have its specific data-testid set. For example, the meta-title-input would have 'meta-title-input', and so on.

By adding these attributes to the component's return statement, the test should now correctly find them when rendering the component during testing.

Now, I'll prepare the diff to reflect these changes in SEOStep.tsx.

To resolve the issue where the test couldn't find expected data-testid attributes, we need to ensure the `SEOStep` component includes all required data-testid mappings. Here's how we can fix it by adding the missing attributes:

```

This change adds the missing `data-testid` attributes to the component, allowing the test to find and mock them correctly.
