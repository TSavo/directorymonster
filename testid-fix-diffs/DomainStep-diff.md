Okay, so I'm trying to help fix this issue where the test is looking for some missing data-testid attributes in the DomainStep component. The problem is that the component doesn't have these attributes defined, which causes the tests to fail.

First, I need to understand what the test is expecting. The test has mock elements like <domain-manager>, <domain-count>, etc., but they aren't present in the actual component. So, the component isn't sending data to those attributes when it should be.

Looking at the component code, I see that it's using several divs and buttons without any data-testid attributes. The test is probably trying to track these elements for interactivity or state updates, so adding the data-testid="..." attributes is necessary.

I think the best approach is to add the missing data-testid attributes to each element in the component where they're not present. For example, each button and div that the test refers to should have their corresponding data-testid set.

Starting with the buttons: there's a remove button for domains and an add button at the bottom. The test expects these to have "domainStep-remove-domain" and "domainStep-add-domain" respectively. I'll need to add those attributes.

Then, looking at the dom elements in the component, like the <p> tags that display counts or headings, they should get data-testid="domain-step-domains" and so on for each specific element.

I also notice a div with id "domainStep-domain-input" which is part of the add domain section. It should have data-testid="domainStep-domain-input".

Each of these changes involves adding one line per element where the data-testid attribute hasn't been set yet. This way, when the test runs, it can correctly find all the expected attributes.

I need to make sure that each change is applied in the correct location and follows the proper syntax for adding a data-testid in React or styled-components. Also, I should ensure that these additions don't conflict with any existing code.

So, the plan is to go through each element in the component where a data-testid isn't present and add it accordingly based on what the test expects.

To fix the issue, we need to add the missing `data-testid` attributes to the respective elements in the DomainStep component. Here's the step-by-step diff:

This change adds the missing `data-testid` attributes to all elements in the component that are being tracked by the test, allowing it to find them and pass its tests.
