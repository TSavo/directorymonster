# DirectoryMonster Next Steps - Updated

## Progress Update:

We've successfully implemented comprehensive test coverage for critical components, utilities, and API endpoints:

1. UI Components:
   - ListingCard.tsx
   - SiteHeader.tsx

2. Core Utilities:
   - redis-client.ts
   - redis-health.ts

3. API Endpoints:
   - /api/healthcheck
   - /api/search
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories
   - /api/site-info
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]
   - Middleware testing (withRedis)

## Current Test Coverage Status:
- Previously: 6.78%
- Current: [Updated percentage will be available after CI run]
- Target: 70-80%

## Remaining Tasks:

### Phase 1: Integration Testing (High Priority)
- Create integration test directory: C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\integration
- Implement tests for critical user flows:
  - Site identity resolution
  - Multitenancy validation
  - Data retrieval and display
  - Search functionality across domains

### Phase 2: Docker Integration (Medium Priority)
- Reintroduce Docker-based testing
- Test configurations in:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\docker-compose.yml
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\Dockerfile
- Implement container health checking

### Phase 3: Advanced Components and Interactions (Medium Priority)
- Test admin components and API interactions:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\components\admin
- Expand search functionality tests:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\lib\search-indexer.ts

### Phase 4: Performance and Security (Low Priority)
- Implement parallel testing using GitHub Actions matrix strategy
- Add security scanning to the CI pipeline
- Optimize Redis queries for better performance

## Timeline:
- Phase 1 (Integration Testing): 1-2 weeks (Starting next week)
- Phase 2 (Docker Integration): 1 week (Following week)
- Phase 3 (Advanced Components): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 4 (Performance & Security): Ongoing

We have completed the API Testing phase, successfully implementing tests for all API endpoints with improved test organization. Each endpoint now has dedicated test files organized by HTTP method, ensuring better maintainability and more focused testing.

Our next focus is integration testing to verify interactions between components and end-to-end functionality across the application.
