# DirectoryMonster Next Steps - Updated

## Progress Update:

We've successfully implemented comprehensive test coverage for critical components and utilities:

1. UI Components:
   - ListingCard.tsx
   - SiteHeader.tsx

2. Core Utilities:
   - redis-client.ts
   - redis-health.ts

3. API Endpoints:
   - /api/healthcheck
   - /api/search
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings
   - Middleware testing (withRedis)

## Current Test Coverage Status:
- Previously: 6.78%
- Current: [Updated percentage will be available after CI run]
- Target: 70-80%

## Remaining Tasks:

### Phase 1: Complete API Testing (Critical Priority)
- Implement tests for remaining API endpoints:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\categories\route.ts
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\site-info\route.ts
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\route.ts

### Phase 2: Integration Testing (High Priority)
- Create integration test directory: C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\integration
- Implement tests for critical user flows:
  - Site identity resolution
  - Multitenancy validation
  - Data retrieval and display
  - Search functionality across domains

### Phase 3: Docker Integration (Medium Priority)
- Reintroduce Docker-based testing
- Test configurations in:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\docker-compose.yml
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\Dockerfile
- Implement container health checking

### Phase 4: Advanced Components and Interactions (Medium Priority)
- Test admin components and API interactions:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\components\admin
- Expand search functionality tests:
  - C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\lib\search-indexer.ts

### Phase 5: Performance and Security (Low Priority)
- Implement parallel testing using GitHub Actions matrix strategy
- Add security scanning to the CI pipeline
- Optimize Redis queries for better performance

## Timeline:
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 5: Ongoing

Once these tasks are completed, we should achieve our target test coverage of 70-80% and have a robust testing infrastructure that ensures code quality through automated testing.
