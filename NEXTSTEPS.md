# DirectoryMonster Implementation Progress

## Recently Completed

### âœ… Completely revamped E2E test architecture
- Created a modular, maintainable test framework in the `tests/e2e/utils/` directory
- Replaced jQuery-style selectors with standard DOM methods
- Added comprehensive error handling and detailed logging
- Implemented screenshot capture for better debugging
- Created focused, single-responsibility test files
- Added documentation with a comprehensive README
- New tests run with `npm run test:e2e:category-management`

### âœ… Implemented missing routes for category management
- Created route structure for `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories`
- Implemented these specific routes:
  - `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/page.tsx` - For category listing page
  - `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/new/page.tsx` - For adding new categories
  - `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId]/edit/page.tsx` - For editing existing categories
- Used existing CategoryTable component for the main listing page
- Created new CategoryForm component for the add/edit pages
- Added proper error handling with component fallbacks
- Ensured reliable component loading with multiple import strategies
- Implemented a site dashboard page to complete the navigation flow

## Next Critical Tasks

### ðŸ”¥ IN PROGRESS: Address component import/export inconsistencies
- Multiple warnings in logs about mismatched imports/exports
- Example: "export 'CategoryTable' was not found in './CategoryTable' (possible exports: default)"
- Need consistent approach for all components (named vs default exports)
- Consider using barrel files (index.ts) with proper export configuration
- Update all components to follow the same export pattern

### ðŸ”¥ Improve test coverage and reliability
- Apply the new modular test approach to other functional areas
- Create similar utility modules for listings, sites, and other features
- Gradually phase out legacy E2E tests in favor of the new architecture
- Add integration tests for new category management routes
- Improve testing for edge cases and error handling

### ðŸ”¥ Enhance data handling and state management
- Implement more robust error handling for API requests
- Add proper loading states for all data fetching operations
- Create consistent state management approach across components
- Improve caching for better performance
- Add data validation on both client and server

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Standardize Component Export Pattern
- Audit all components for export inconsistencies
- Create a standard export pattern for all components
- Update index.ts files to provide both named and default exports
- Write automated tests to verify export consistency
- Document the export pattern for team reference

### 2. Extend E2E Test Framework
- Apply the modular test pattern to listings management
- Create site management test utilities
- Update remaining E2E tests to use the new utilities
- Add visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
- Document the expanded test framework

### 3. Improve Error Handling
- Create consistent error boundary components
- Implement retry mechanisms for API requests
- Add fallbacks for failed component loading
- Enhance error logging for better diagnostics
- Create user-friendly error messages

## Previously Completed

### ðŸ”Ž Identified critical route structure issue in application
- Discovered missing page routes for `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories`
- E2E tests were failing because the expected page routes didn't exist
- Found 404 errors in server logs for category page requests
- Components referenced routes like `/admin/sites/${siteSlug}/categories` that weren't implemented
- API routes existed (`/api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories`) but UI routes were missing

### âœ… Created comprehensive admin-categories-e2e.js test suite
- Implemented complete E2E tests for category management
- Created tests covering all CRUD operations for categories
- Added tests for pagination and hierarchical categories
- Used navigation utilities for improved reliability
- Included robust error handling and diagnostics

### âœ… Implemented categories-debug-navigation.js
- Created a comprehensive navigation utility file for E2E testing
- Added robust functions for reliable page navigation in tests
- Implemented multiple fallback strategies for finding UI elements
- Added detailed logging and diagnostics for navigation issues
- This makes category management E2E tests more reliable and easier to debug

## Previously Completed Work

### 1. Comprehensive Debug API Endpoints âœ…
- Created `/api/debug/env` endpoint for environment variables
- Created `/api/debug/redis-data` endpoint for Redis inspection
- Created `/api/debug/module-paths` endpoint for module resolution
- Created `/api/debug/site-resolver` endpoint for site debugging
- Created `/api/debug/auth-bypass` endpoint for auth testing

### 2. Docker Configuration Improvements âœ…
- Updated Dockerfile.dev to properly copy all source files
- Set NODE_ENV=development explicitly
- Created rebuild-docker.sh script for clean rebuilds
- Fixed volume mounting in docker-compose.yml to preserve imports

### 3. Authentication Enhancements âœ…
- Added detailed logging to ZKP verification
- Forced verification success in development environment
- Added verbose logging of environment variables and proof structure
- Created auth bypass for E2E testing

### 4. Site Data Management âœ…
- Created scripts/create-test-sites.js for direct Redis data creation
- Added healthcheck endpoints for application and Redis
- Enhanced site resolver error handling
- Added verification of Redis data creation

### 5. Test Infrastructure Improvements âœ…
- Increased navigation timeouts in E2E tests
- Created missing component index exports
- Updated import paths for better module resolution
- Added documentation with clear run instructions

### 6. Category Component Fixes âœ…
- Fixed circular reference issue in CategoryTable.tsx renderHierarchicalRows function
- Implemented safeHierarchy with React.useMemo to prevent circular structures
- Added CategoryErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling
- Fixed exports in `src/components/admin/categories/index.ts` for proper importing
