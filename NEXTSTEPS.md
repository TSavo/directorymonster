# DirectoryMonster Next Steps - Updated

## Progress Update:

We've successfully implemented comprehensive test coverage for critical components, utilities, API endpoints, and search functionality:

1. UI Components:
   - ListingCard.tsx
   - SiteHeader.tsx
   - AdminDashboard
   - Search components suite (Form, Results, Bar, Icon)

2. Core Utilities:
   - redis-client.ts
   - redis-health.ts
   - site-utils.ts

3. API Endpoints:
   - /api/healthcheck
   - /api/search
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories
   - /api/site-info
   - /api/sites/[siteSlug]
   - Middleware testing (withRedis)

4. Integration Tests:
   - User flows (listing and category management)
   - Multitenancy validation
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Error handling
   - Performance (rate limiting, large datasets)

## Current Test Coverage Status:
- Previously: 6.78%
- Current: ~12% (improving with each component test enhancement)
- Target: 70-80%

We have successfully implemented all core admin interface components, including ListingTable, CategoryTable, and admin layout components. Currently, we're focusing on improving test quality for the Category Management components to ensure they are robust, maintainable, and less brittle against UI changes. Our approach includes using data-testid attributes, focusing on behavior rather than implementation details, and improving accessibility testing.
