## Component and Testing Approach

Our strategic approach focuses on quality, maintainability, and comprehensive testing:

### Current Strategy
- Implement tests manually for better control and quality
- Focus on thorough test coverage for critical components
- Maintain clear component architecture with separation of concerns
- Centralize documentation in /specs directory for better organization
- Ensure alignment between component implementation and E2E tests
- Add data-testid attributes to critical UI elements for reliable testing
- Address server-side rendering issues for proper component function

### Implementation Progress
‚úÖ TypeScript conversion of core modules completed
‚úÖ Manual implementation of key components (DomainManager, SiteForm)
‚úÖ Custom hooks created for better separation of concerns
‚úÖ Component tests with high coverage implemented
‚úÖ Comprehensive test documentation created
‚úÖ Documentation consolidated into logical structure

### Focus Areas
1. Expand test coverage for remaining components
2. Implement advanced analytics components
3. Improve integration testing for multi-tenant functionality
4. Enhance accessibility compliance across all components

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix server-side rendering issues with 'use client' directives 
2. Enhance ZKPLogin component with proper data-testid attributes
3. Update error handling in login component for consistent selectors
4. Fix CSRF token handling in authentication API
5. Update E2E login test to match current component implementation
6. Execute and validate E2E tests for authentication flows
7. Implement additional component tests to reach 80% coverage target
8. Integrate documentation into development workflow
9. Develop PerformanceCharts component with data visualization
10. Add accessibility tests for all public-facing components
