# DirectoryMonster Implementation Next Steps

## Recently Completed
- ✅ Standardized export patterns in dashboard and layout modules
- ✅ Created export verification script (scripts/verify-exports.js)
- ✅ Fixed dual-export pattern in primary components
- ✅ Updated barrel files with consistent standardized exports
- ✅ Reduced warnings in Docker logs related to export issues
- ✅ Updated auth module components with standardized dual-export pattern
- ✅ Updated category module components with standardized dual-export pattern
- ✅ Updated dashboard subcomponents with standardized dual-export pattern
- ✅ Fixed client component issues by adding "use client" directives
- ✅ Fixed admin/layout.tsx imports to use direct component imports
- ✅ Fixed dashboard module barrel file for proper component imports

## Priority Tasks (Based on Verification Script)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Auth Module Export Standardization 
- Updated 7 auth components to add missing default exports:
  - AuthContainer.tsx, FirstUserSetup.tsx, LogoutButton.tsx
  - PasswordResetForm.tsx, RoleGuard.tsx, SessionManager.tsx, ZKPLogin.tsx
- Fixed auth/index.ts barrel file to follow standardized pattern

### ✅ COMPLETED: Category Components Export Standardization
- Updated 5 category components to add missing named exports:
  - CategoryTableEmptyState.tsx, CategoryTableError.tsx
  - CategoryTablePagination.tsx, CategoryTableRow.tsx
  - CategoryTableSortHeader.tsx
- Standardized categories/components/index.ts barrel file

### ✅ COMPLETED: Dashboard Subcomponents Export Standardization
- Added named exports to 2 dashboard subcomponents:
  - ActivityFeedItem.tsx, StatisticCard.tsx
- Updated dashboard/components/index.ts barrel file

### ✅ COMPLETED: Barrel File Standardization
- Standardized 5 barrel files to follow the standardized export pattern:
  - admin/index.ts - Added export defaults for subdirectories
  - layout/icons/index.ts - Fixed circular reference and added proper exports
  - sites/index.ts - Replaced auto-generated export pattern with standardized pattern
  - sites/hooks/index.ts - Added standardized export pattern
  - dashboard/hooks/index.ts - Added missing named exports
- Verification script confirms all files now follow the standardized pattern

## New Priority Tasks

### Next.js App Router Compatibility
- [ ] Add "use client" directive to all interactive components
- [ ] Update component organization to better align with Next.js app router
- [ ] Fix remaining e2e test failures
- [ ] Add documentation on proper component organization with app router

### Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add automated test for export verification in CI pipeline
- [ ] Improve test coverage for dashboard components
- [ ] Fix flaky e2e tests that fail sporadically
- [ ] Add more robust error handling in tests

## Future Work

### Export Standardization Improvements
- Add export verification to CI pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Create tooling to automatically generate standardized component files
- Update project documentation with export pattern guidelines
- Add eslint rules to enforce proper export patterns
