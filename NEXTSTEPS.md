# DirectoryMonster Implementation Progress

## Next Critical Tasks

### ðŸ”¥ Fix missing routes for category management
- Need to create route structure for `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories`
- Required routes:
  - `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/page.tsx` - For category listing
  - `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/new/page.tsx` - For adding new categories
  - `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId]/edit/page.tsx` - For editing
- The Category component code already exists but the routes don't
- Application components specifically reference these routes
- Tests will continue to fail until these routes are implemented

### ðŸ”¥ Address component import/export inconsistencies
- Multiple warnings in logs about mismatched imports/exports
- Example: "export 'CategoryTable' was not found in './CategoryTable' (possible exports: default)"
- Need consistent approach for all components (named vs default exports)
- Consider using barrel files (index.ts) with proper export configuration
- Update all components to follow the same export pattern

### ðŸ”¥ Fix selector issues in E2E tests
- Tests use jQuery-style selectors like 'button:contains("Add Category")'
- These aren't supported in standard DOM querySelector
- Update selectors to use standard CSS selectors or use a more robust selection approach
- Puppeteer supports $$ for more advanced selectors, consider using when appropriate

## Most Recently Completed

### ðŸ”Ž Identified critical route structure issue in application
- Discovered missing page routes for `/admin/sites/[siteSlug]/categories`
- E2E tests are failing because the expected page routes don't exist
- Found 404 errors in server logs for category page requests
- Components reference routes like `/admin/sites/${siteSlug}/categories` that aren't implemented
- API routes exist (`/api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories`) but UI routes are missing

### âœ… Created comprehensive admin-categories-e2e.js test suite
- Implemented complete E2E tests for category management
- Created tests covering all CRUD operations for categories
- Added tests for pagination and hierarchical categories
- Uses the navigation utilities for improved reliability
- Includes robust error handling and diagnostics

### âœ… Implemented categories-debug-navigation.js
- Created a comprehensive navigation utility file for E2E testing
- Added robust functions for reliable page navigation in tests
- Implemented multiple fallback strategies for finding UI elements
- Added detailed logging and diagnostics for navigation issues
- This makes category management E2E tests more reliable and easier to debug

## Previously Completed Work

### 1. Comprehensive Debug API Endpoints âœ…
- Created `/api/debug/env` endpoint for environment variables
- Created `/api/debug/redis-data` endpoint for Redis inspection
- Created `/api/debug/module-paths` endpoint for module resolution
- Created `/api/debug/site-resolver` endpoint for site debugging
- Created `/api/debug/auth-bypass` endpoint for auth testing

### 2. Docker Configuration Improvements âœ…
- Updated Dockerfile.dev to properly copy all source files
- Set NODE_ENV=development explicitly
- Created rebuild-docker.sh script for clean rebuilds
- Fixed volume mounting in docker-compose.yml to preserve imports

### 3. Authentication Enhancements âœ…
- Added detailed logging to ZKP verification

### 4. Site Data Management âœ…
- Created scripts/create-test-sites.js for direct Redis data creation
- Added healthcheck endpoints for application and Redis
- Enhanced site resolver error handling
- Added verification of Redis data creation

### 5. Test Infrastructure Improvements âœ…
- Increased navigation timeouts in E2E tests
- Created missing component index exports
- Updated import paths for better module resolution
- Added documentation with clear run instructions

### 6. Category Component Fixes âœ…
- Fixed circular reference issue in CategoryTable.tsx renderHierarchicalRows function
- Implemented safeHierarchy with React.useMemo to prevent circular structures
- Added CategoryErrorBoundary component for graceful error handling
- Fixed exports in `src/components/admin/categories/index.ts` for proper importing
