## Test Generator Tool Status

We've evaluated the test generator tool and identified significant issues with the custom template engine:

### Issues Identified
1. Complex custom syntax that's difficult to debug
2. Problems with nested templates and map operations
3. Need for multiple processing passes
4. Limited error handling
5. High maintenance overhead

### Decision
After thorough evaluation, we've decided to replace the custom template engine with Handlebars:
- Standard, well-tested templating solution
- Better syntax for loops, conditionals, and variable substitution
- Proper error reporting
- Easier maintenance
- Extensive documentation

### Implementation Plan
1. Install Handlebars as a dependency
2. Create a TemplateEngine wrapper class to handle Handlebars setup
3. Convert existing templates to Handlebars syntax
4. Update the ComponentScaffolder to use the new engine
5. Test with simple components to verify functionality

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Implement SiteForm component manually to meet current deadline
2. Start Handlebars integration in parallel for future component generation
3. Gradually migrate existing templates to the new system

## Upcoming Focus

While we await the Handlebars integration, we'll focus on:
1. Manual implementation of the SiteForm component
2. Complete comprehensive tests for Site Management components
3. Create the site settings page in the admin interface
4. Develop necessary routes and navigation links
