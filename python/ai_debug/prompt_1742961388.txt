        PAGE TYPE DEFINITIONS:
        - PRODUCT page: A page focused on a single product with details, price, and purchase options
        - CATEGORY page: A page showing multiple products in a list or grid with limited details per item
        - NEITHER: Not related to products (homepage, blog, error page, captcha, etc.)
        
        JSON SCHEMA:
        {
          "page_type": string,         // Must be exactly "PRODUCT", "CATEGORY", or "NEITHER"
          "confidence": number,        // Integer from 0-100 indicating confidence level
          "reason": string,            // Brief explanation of classification
          "recommended_links": [       // ONLY include for CATEGORY pages, omit for others
            {
              "url": string,           // Full URL of recommended product link
              "reason": string         // Why this link was selected (e.g., "Matches nes")
            }
          ]
        }
        
        INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINK RECOMMENDATIONS:
        IF page_type is "CATEGORY":
            - Include 1-3 links that are most likely to be PRODUCT pages (not subcategories)
            - Prioritize links that match the search term "nes game raygar top rated" or category "nes"
            - Select links that appear to be specific products with price information
            - Avoid links to search results, filters, or "view all" type pages
            - If page has > 10 products, try to select popular or featured ones
        ELSE:
            - Do NOT include the "recommended_links" field at all
        
        EXAMPLES:
        For a PRODUCT page:
        {
          "page_type": "PRODUCT",
          "confidence": 95,
          "reason": "Page focuses on a single nes product with price, description, and add to cart button"
        }
        
        For a CATEGORY page:
        {
          "page_type": "CATEGORY",
          "confidence": 85,
          "reason": "Page displays multiple nes products in a grid format with thumbnails and brief descriptions",
          "recommended_links": [
            {
              "url": "https://example.com/product/123",
              "reason": "This appears to be a specific nes product with clear pricing information"
            },
            {
              "url": "https://example.com/product/456",
              "reason": "Featured nes item that closely matches search term"
            }
          ]
        }
        
        For a NEITHER page:
        {
          "page_type": "NEITHER",
          "confidence": 70,
          "reason": "This is a blog post about nes products but doesn't sell them directly"
        }
        
        RETURN ONLY VALID JSON WITH NO ADDITIONAL TEXT OR EXPLANATION.
