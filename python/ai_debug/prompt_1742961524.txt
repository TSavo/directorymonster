        A product page typically:
        1. Is focused on a single product (not a list of products)
        2. Has product details like price, description, images
        3. Often has "add to cart" or "buy now" functionality
        4. Contains product specifications or features
        
        Answer with a simple "YES" if this is a product page, or "NO" if it's not (e.g., if it's a search results page, 
        category page, homepage, etc.).
        
        Then, provide a brief explanation for your decision (1-2 sentences).
        
        Format your response exactly like this:
        DECISION: YES or NO
        REASON: Your explanation here
