# SiteForm Refactoring Summary

## Problem

The original SiteForm component was complex and difficult to test because:
1. It had too many responsibilities (form state, validation, API calls, multi-step navigation)
2. It used a complex state management system with the useSites hook
3. Form validation, navigation, and submission were tightly coupled
4. Tests were failing because they couldn't properly interact with the component

## Solution

We refactored the SiteForm component into smaller, more focused components following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

1. **SiteFormContext**: A context provider that manages form state and API calls
2. **SiteFormContainer**: A container component that handles navigation and renders the appropriate step
3. **Step Components**: Individual components for each form step that use the context

## Implementation Details

### 1. SiteFormContext

- Manages form state using useReducer
- Handles form validation
- Provides API for updating fields and submitting the form
- Exposes state and methods through context

### 2. Step Components

- BasicInfoStep: Handles name, slug, and description fields
- DomainStep: Handles domain management
- ThemeStep: Handles theme selection and custom CSS

### 3. Testing Approach

For each component, we:
1. Wrote failing tests first
2. Implemented the component to make the tests pass
3. Refactored as needed

## Benefits

1. **Improved Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Smaller, more focused components are easier to understand
4. **Better State Management**: Using context and reducer pattern for predictable state updates
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one component don't affect others

## Test Coverage

We created comprehensive tests for:
- SiteFormContext (3 tests)
- BasicInfoStep (3 tests)
- DomainStep (6 tests)
- ThemeStep (3 tests)

All tests are passing, demonstrating that our refactored components work correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining step components (SEOStep, SiteFormPreview)
2. Update the SiteForm component to use the new components
3. Update the existing tests to work with the refactored components
4. Add integration tests for the full form

## Conclusion

By breaking up the monolithic SiteForm component into smaller, more focused components, we've made it more testable, maintainable, and easier to understand. The use of context for state management provides a clean API for components to interact with the form state without prop drilling.

This refactoring follows best practices for React component design and demonstrates the value of Test-Driven Development in creating robust, well-tested components.
