# Security Components Test Coverage Specification

This specification outlines the test coverage requirements for the security components implemented in the bcrypt-ZKP integration PR.

## Overview

The security improvements implemented in PR #308 include several new components and enhancements that require comprehensive test coverage:

1. Worker Pool for Authentication
2. Concurrency Management with Redis
3. Enhanced Rate Limiting with Exponential Backoff
4. IP Blocking with Risk-Based Thresholds
5. CAPTCHA Integration (Server and Client)

This document specifies the test requirements for each component to ensure proper functionality and security.

## Test Requirements

### 1. Worker Pool Tests

The worker pool implementation (`src/lib/auth/worker-pool.ts` and `src/lib/auth/auth-worker.js`) requires the following tests:

#### Unit Tests

- **Worker Creation**: Test that workers are created correctly with the specified pool size
- **Task Queue**: Test that tasks are properly queued when no workers are available
- **Task Execution**: Test that tasks are properly executed and results are returned
- **Error Handling**: Test that worker errors are properly handled and reported
- **Worker Recovery**: Test that failed workers are replaced with new ones
- **Shutdown**: Test that the worker pool can be properly shut down

#### Integration Tests

- **Concurrent Processing**: Test that multiple tasks can be processed concurrently
- **Performance**: Test that the worker pool improves performance under load
- **Resource Management**: Test that the worker pool properly manages resources

### 2. Concurrency Management Tests

The concurrency management implementation (`src/lib/auth/concurrency.ts`) requires the following tests:

#### Unit Tests

- **Lock Acquisition**: Test that distributed locks can be acquired
- **Lock Release**: Test that distributed locks can be released
- **Lock Expiry**: Test that locks automatically expire after the specified time
- **Request Tracking**: Test that authentication requests are properly tracked
- **Request Completion**: Test that completed requests are properly removed from tracking
- **Concurrent Request Limits**: Test that the system enforces limits on concurrent requests

#### Integration Tests

- **Distributed Locking**: Test that locks work across multiple instances
- **Race Conditions**: Test that the system handles race conditions properly
- **High Concurrency**: Test behavior under high concurrency scenarios

### 3. Enhanced Rate Limiting Tests

The enhanced rate limiting implementation (`src/lib/auth/progressive-delay.ts`) requires the following tests:

#### Unit Tests

- **Delay Calculation**: Test that delays are calculated correctly with exponential backoff
- **Jitter**: Test that jitter is properly applied to delays
- **Maximum Delay**: Test that delays are capped at the maximum value
- **Failed Attempt Recording**: Test that failed attempts are properly recorded
- **Delay Reset**: Test that delays are properly reset after successful authentication

#### Integration Tests

- **Progressive Delays**: Test that delays increase progressively with failed attempts
- **Distributed State**: Test that rate limiting works across multiple instances

### 4. IP Blocking Tests

The enhanced IP blocking implementation (`src/lib/auth/ip-blocker.ts`) requires the following tests:

#### Unit Tests

- **Risk Level Assignment**: Test that risk levels can be assigned to IP addresses
- **Risk Level Retrieval**: Test that risk levels can be retrieved for IP addresses
- **Threshold Configuration**: Test that thresholds are properly configured based on risk level
- **Block Duration**: Test that block durations are properly set based on risk level
- **Failed Attempt Recording**: Test that failed attempts are properly recorded
- **IP Blocking**: Test that IPs are blocked after exceeding thresholds
- **IP Unblocking**: Test that IPs are unblocked after the block duration expires

#### Integration Tests

- **Risk-Based Blocking**: Test that high-risk IPs are blocked more aggressively
- **Audit Logging**: Test that blocking events are properly logged

### 5. CAPTCHA Integration Tests

The CAPTCHA integration (`src/lib/auth/captcha-service.ts` and `src/components/admin/auth/CaptchaWidget.tsx`) requires the following tests:

#### Server-Side Unit Tests

- **CAPTCHA Requirement**: Test that CAPTCHA is required after the configured number of failed attempts
- **Threshold Configuration**: Test that thresholds are properly configured based on risk level
- **CAPTCHA Verification**: Test that CAPTCHA tokens are properly verified
- **CAPTCHA Reset**: Test that CAPTCHA requirements are reset after successful verification

#### Client-Side Unit Tests

- **Component Rendering**: Test that the CAPTCHA widget renders correctly
- **reCAPTCHA Integration**: Test that the component integrates with reCAPTCHA when configured
- **Custom CAPTCHA**: Test that the custom CAPTCHA implementation works correctly
- **Verification Callbacks**: Test that verification callbacks are properly triggered
- **Error Handling**: Test that error callbacks are properly triggered
- **Expiry Handling**: Test that expiry callbacks are properly triggered

#### Integration Tests

- **Authentication Flow**: Test that CAPTCHA is properly integrated into the authentication flow
- **Risk-Based CAPTCHA**: Test that high-risk IPs require CAPTCHA sooner

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Test Files Structure

```
tests/
  lib/
    auth/
      worker-pool.test.ts
      concurrency.test.ts
      progressive-delay.test.ts
      ip-blocker.test.ts
      captcha-service.test.ts
  components/
    admin/
      auth/
        CaptchaWidget.test.tsx
  integration/
    auth/
      security-measures.test.ts
```

### Mocking Strategy

- **Redis**: Mock Redis client for unit tests
- **Worker Threads**: Mock Worker threads for unit tests
- **reCAPTCHA**: Mock reCAPTCHA API for unit tests
- **Fetch API**: Mock fetch API for CAPTCHA verification tests

### Test Environment

- Unit tests should run in isolation with mocked dependencies
- Integration tests should use a test Redis instance
- Component tests should use React Testing Library and JSDOM

## Acceptance Criteria

- All unit tests must pass
- All integration tests must pass
- Test coverage for new components should be at least 80%
- Tests should verify both success and failure scenarios
- Tests should verify security constraints are enforced

## Timeline

- Unit tests should be implemented first
- Component tests should be implemented next
- Integration tests should be implemented last
- All tests should be completed before merging the PR
