## Current Status - Test Coverage Improvement Phase 3 - API Testing âœ…

We're continuing our work on Phase 3 of the test coverage improvement efforts, focusing on implementing tests for the remaining API endpoints. Today we began implementing tests for the categories API endpoint and are splitting the test files into smaller, more manageable files to improve maintainability and test run performance.

### Completed Tasks

     - Tested pattern-based key searching
     - Tested transaction support
     - Tested simplified KV interface
   - Created comprehensive tests for redis-health.ts
     - Tested successful connection scenarios
     - Tested various error conditions
     - Tested error handling

   - Implemented tests for `/api/healthcheck` endpoint
     - Tested healthy and unhealthy states
     - Tested response structure and status codes
     - Tested environment variable handling
   - Implemented tests for `/api/search` endpoint
     - Tested query validation
     - Tested search results format
     - Tested error handling
     - Tested site-specific search filtering
   - Implemented tests for `/api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings` endpoint
     - Tested GET endpoint for retrieving listings
     - Tested POST endpoint for creating listings
     - Tested validation rules
     - Tested error handling
     - Tested Redis transaction handling
     - Tested search indexing integration
   - Tested API middleware (withRedis)

### Current Work - Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 3 - Remaining API Endpoints)

Today's focus is on implementing tests for the remaining three API endpoints with an improved test organization approach:

1. **Categories API Endpoint**:
   - Test files:
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\categories\get.test.ts` - Testing GET functionality
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\categories\post.test.ts` - Testing POST functionality
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\categories\route.ts`
   - Testing validation rules
   - Testing error handling
   - Testing Redis operations

2. **Site Info API Endpoint**:
   - Test files:
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\site-info\get.test.ts` - Testing GET functionality
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\site-info\route.ts` 
   - Testing site information retrieval
   - Testing domain-based site resolution
   - Testing error handling

3. **Site-specific API Endpoint**:
   - Test files:
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\site\get.test.ts` - Testing GET functionality
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\route.ts`
   - Testing site configuration retrieval
   - Testing error handling

### Testing Approach

For each API endpoint, we're following a structured approach with improved organization:

1. **Splitting Test Files**: Separating tests for different HTTP methods (GET, POST) into individual files for better maintainability and clarity
2. **Testing Success Paths**: Verifying expected behavior with valid inputs
3. **Testing Error Paths**: Verifying error handling with invalid inputs 
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Verifying behavior with edge case inputs
5. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Using mocks for Redis and other external dependencies
6. **Testing Authorization**: Verifying proper authorization checks where applicable

### Next Steps (After API Testing Completion)

1. **Begin Integration Testing (Phase 4)**:
   - Create integration test directory
   - Implement tests for critical user flows
   - Test multitenancy and site isolation

2. **Docker Integration (Phase 5)**:
   - Reintroduce Docker-based testing
   - Add container health checking
   - Implement Docker-specific tests

### Timeline

- Complete API Endpoint Testing: Today (March 27, 2025)
- Begin Integration Testing (Phase 4): Next week
- Docker Integration (Phase 5): Following week

With the improved test organization, we're not only increasing test coverage but also enhancing the maintainability and readability of our test suite.
