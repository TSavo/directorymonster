# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - March 30, 2025

Working on merging pull requests for two major features:

1. **PR #22: Implement basic category and listing management**
   - Addresses issue #19
   - Adds category and listing CRUD functionality
   - Implements tenant isolation for data
   - Includes search indexing enhancements

2. **PR #29: Implement user authentication and ACL-based permissions**
   - Addresses issue #23
   - Implements ACL-based permission system
   - Adds user management UI components
   - Includes API endpoints for user management
   - Features secure password handling

## PR Merge Plan

1. First merge PR #22 (category/listing management) as it's more foundational
2. Then merge PR #29 (authentication system) as it may depend on core functionality

## Next Steps After Merges

1. Verify the successful integration of both features
2. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality works as expected
3. Check for any merge-related issues or conflicts
4. Update documentation to reflect the new features
5. Close the respective issues once PRs are successfully merged
