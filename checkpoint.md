# Checkpoint: Implementing PermissionGuard Component for ACL System - Update

## Current Status
I'm continuing work on Issue #57: Implement PermissionGuard Component. The component implementation is complete, but the tests are failing due to Next.js router context issues.

After analyzing the code and test files in detail, I've identified the key differences between the passing TenantGuard tests and the failing PermissionGuard tests:

1. The TenantGuard tests use direct Jest mocks for all dependencies (`jest.mock('../../hooks/useAuth')`) while PermissionGuard tests use a different approach with a TestWrapper and module mocks in that wrapper.

2. The key issue appears to be in how the Next.js router is mocked. The error message "invariant expected app router to be mounted" indicates the Next.js router context is not properly initialized.

3. The current approach in `test-wrapper.tsx` uses `jest.mock('next/navigation', ...)` but this doesn't create a proper React context for the router that components can access.

## Implementation Progress

Current progress:
1. ✅ PermissionGuard component implementation is complete
2. ✅ Test files structure is set up correctly
3. ❌ Tests are failing due to router context issues
4. ✅ Identified that TenantGuard tests and PermissionGuard tests use different testing approaches

## Current Focus

I'm now working on aligning the PermissionGuard tests with the successful approach used in TenantGuard tests. Looking at both implementations:

1. TenantGuard tests:
   - Use direct Jest mocks with `jest.mock()`
   - Mock each hook individually
   - Don't use a TestWrapper component with context

2. PermissionGuard tests:
   - Use a TestWrapper component
   - Mock hooks inside the TestWrapper via imports
   - Use a different mocking strategy

The solution is to adapt the PermissionGuard tests to follow the same pattern as the TenantGuard tests, which are already working.

## Next Steps

1. Refactor the PermissionGuard tests to use the same approach as TenantGuard tests:
   - Move the mocks outside the TestWrapper
   - Use direct Jest mocks with `jest.mock()` at the module level
   - Simplify the TestWrapper or remove it if not needed

2. Specifically update:
   - Move the `jest.mock()` calls from test-wrapper.tsx to the test files
   - Update the mock implementations to match the TenantGuard approach
   - Ensure consistent setup across all test files

3. Run the tests to verify the fix works

4. Complete the PR for issue #57 with:
   - Working PermissionGuard component
   - Passing tests
   - Documentation on how to use the component

## Implementation Plan

1. Update test-wrapper.tsx to follow the TenantGuard pattern
2. Fix the multiple-permissions.test.tsx first (one of the failing tests)
3. Apply the same fix to error-handling.test.tsx
4. Run tests to verify fix
5. Complete documentation and PR

## Implementation Benefits
The completed PermissionGuard component:
1. Provides a clean, reusable way to handle UI permission checks
2. Integrates seamlessly with the existing multi-tenant ACL system
3. Follows the separation of concerns principle with a focused API
4. Complements the TenantGuard component for layered security
5. Offers flexible configuration options for various UI scenarios
