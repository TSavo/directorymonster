## Implementation Status - [2025-03-30 22:45]

I've completed the implementation of the site management components with a modular, component-based architecture. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

1. **SiteForm Component**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Implemented a modular multi-step form with step navigation
   - Created StepNavigation and FormActions components
   - Integrated with the useSites hook for data management
   - Supporting components include BasicInfoStep, DomainStep, ThemeStep, and SEOStep

2. **SiteTable Components**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Created a modular table structure following the project pattern
   - Implemented SiteTableHeader for search and actions
   - Added SiteTableSortHeader for column sorting
   - Created SiteTableRow for individual site entries
   - Implemented SiteTablePagination for navigation controls
   - Added SiteMobileCard for responsive mobile view
   - Created DeleteConfirmationModal for safe deletion

3. **Mobile Views**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - SiteMobileCard provides a responsive card layout for mobile devices
   - Responsive design in SiteTableHeader with appropriate layout changes
   - Mobile-friendly pagination controls

4. **Documentation**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Created comprehensive README.md for the site management components
   - Documented component structure and architecture
   - Added usage examples and API reference
   - Included testing approach and future improvements

5. **Current Focus - Testing**:
   - üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Writing tests for site management components
      - Following existing test organization pattern with modular approach
      - Completed tests:
        - Core Form Components: StepNavigation, FormActions
        - Form Step Components: BasicInfoStep, DomainStep, ThemeStep, SEOStep
        - Table Components: SiteTable, SiteTableHeader, SiteTableRow, SiteTablePagination
        - Mobile Components: SiteMobileCard
        - Modals: DeleteConfirmationModal (with keyboard accessibility tests)
      - Next to implement:
        - SiteForm container tests
        - Hook tests (useSites)

### Testing Progress

I'm implementing tests in the following directories:

```
tests/admin/sites/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/           # Tests for individual components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ table/                # Tests for table components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                # Tests for custom hooks
```

Test files will mirror the component structure and follow best practices from CLAUDE.md:
- Use data-testid attributes for selections
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Include accessibility testing
- Test hooks separately with renderHook

### Future Work

After this implementation, the next priorities would be:

1. Writing comprehensive tests for all components
2. Implementing the additional features mentioned in the README's "Future Improvements" section
3. Refining the UI based on user feedback

After reviewing the file structure, I found that we've made more progress than noted. Here's an updated status:

### Admin MVP Implementation
- Categories Management: ‚úÖ COMPLETE 
- Listings Management: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- Sites Management: ‚è±Ô∏è PENDING

### Listing Components Status
- Multi-step form components created (BasicInfo, Category, Media, Pricing, Backlink) ‚úÖ
- FormPreview component implemented ‚úÖ
- Table components for listing management implemented ‚úÖ
- Advanced filtering components (ListingFilterBar, CategoryFilterTree) implemented ‚úÖ
- Mobile views mostly implemented (ListingCardHeader, ListingCardContent, ListingCardActions) ‚úÖ
- Missing: 
  - MobileFilterDrawer component ‚úÖ

### E2E Testing
- New testing framework with modular organization implemented
- Admin dashboard tests successfully converted to new pattern
- Improved component selection with data-testid attributes

## Sprint Plan - Admin MVP Completion

After implementing the required components for site management, I've made significant progress. Here's what I've accomplished:

### Sites Management Implementation Plan

#### 1. Completed Components

**Core Components:**
- ‚úÖ SiteForm.tsx - Original implementation exists (will be updated to multi-step)
- ‚úÖ DomainManager.tsx - Domain management component
- ‚úÖ SiteSettings.tsx - Settings implementation
- ‚úÖ SEOSettings.tsx - SEO configuration component

**New Components Created:**
- ‚úÖ BasicInfoStep.tsx - Form step for site name, slug, description
- ‚úÖ DomainStep.tsx - Wrapper for DomainManager to use in multi-step form
- ‚úÖ ThemeStep.tsx - Form step for theme selection and custom CSS
- ‚úÖ SEOStep.tsx - Wrapper for SEOSettings to use in multi-step form
- ‚úÖ SiteFormPreview.tsx - Preview component using modular approach

**Preview Components:**
- ‚úÖ BasicInfoPreview.tsx - Preview for basic site info
- ‚úÖ DomainsPreview.tsx - Preview for domains
- ‚úÖ ThemePreview.tsx - Preview for theme settings
- ‚úÖ SEOPreview.tsx - Preview for SEO settings

**Hooks:**
- ‚úÖ useDomains.ts - Domain management hook
- ‚úÖ useSites.ts - Comprehensive site management hook (modular architecture)
  - ‚úÖ types.ts - Type definitions for site data
  - ‚úÖ validation.ts - Validation logic
  - ‚úÖ api.ts - API integration functions
  - ‚úÖ index.ts - Main hook implementation

#### 2. Remaining Work

**Next Steps:**
1. Update SiteForm.tsx to use the new multi-step approach
2. Create SiteTable and related components for listing sites
3. Create mobile views for site management
4. Write tests for all components
5. Create documentation for the completed implementation

### Testing & Documentation Plan
- Add tests for each component:
  - Basic rendering tests
  - Interaction tests
  - Mobile responsiveness tests
  - Accessibility tests
- Document the implementation pattern in a README.md in the sites component folder
- Update admin MVP documentation

### Next Steps
1. Update SiteForm.tsx to use the multi-step approach
2. Create SiteTable components for listing sites
3. Implement mobile views for site management
4. Write tests for all components
5. Create documentation

## Implementation Plan - [2025-03-30 19:00]

After reviewing the code structure, I have a clear understanding of what needs to be done. Here's my plan for implementing the remaining components:

### 1. Updating SiteForm.tsx to Multi-Step Approach

After starting work on updating the SiteForm component, I realize it's becoming too large and complex. Instead, I'll break it down into smaller components:

- Create a new, simplified SiteForm as a container component
- Implement step navigation and multi-step logic in a separate StepNavigation component
- Use the existing step components (BasicInfoStep, DomainStep, etc.)
- Move form submission logic to a separate hook
- Create a separate FormActions component for the navigation buttons

This approach will make the code more maintainable and easier to test.

### 2. Creating SiteTable Components

I'll create a modular SiteTable component for site listing and management:

- Main SiteTable component
- SiteTableRow for individual site entries
- SiteTableHeader for search and filtering
- Mobile-optimized views
- Delete confirmation modal
- Implement sorting and pagination using the useSites hook

### 3. Mobile View Implementation

Needed mobile components:

- SiteMobileCard for responsive listing
- MobileFilterDrawer for site filtering on small screens
- Responsive adaptations for the form steps

### 4. Testing Strategy

I'll implement tests for all components:

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for form steps working together
- Validation and error handling tests
- Mobile responsiveness tests
- Accessibility tests

### 5. Documentation

I'll create comprehensive documentation for the site management system:

- Implementation guide in sites/README.md
- Update component documentation with JSDoc
- Document the testing approach

I'll start by implementing the multi-step form since that's the most complex component, then move on to the table components.
