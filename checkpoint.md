### Working on Issue #37: Fix failing tests systematically

I've made significant progress fixing the failing tests systematically:

#### Fixed Issues

1. **Fixed Circular Dependency in useSites.ts**:
   - Modified `src/components/admin/sites/hooks/useSites.ts` to properly import from the directory
   - Changed imports from `'./useSites'` to `'./useSites/index'` to avoid circular reference
   - This resolves the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors in site-related tests

2. **Created Global Test Data Setup**:
   - Added a new global test data setup file at `tests/__setup__/global-test-data.js`
   - Populated the `global.__TEST_DATA__` object with mock data for sites, users, categories, and listings
   - Updated jest.config.js to include this setup file in the `setupFilesAfterEnv` array

3. **Enhanced Module Resolution in Jest Config**:
   - Improved the moduleNameMapper in jest.config.js to better handle path aliases
   - Added more specific mappings for app directories and components

4. **Fixed Categories Hook Index**:
   - Resolved issues in the `src/components/admin/categories/hooks/index.ts` file
   - Fixed reference errors by properly importing the hooks before exporting them

5. **Fixed Syntax Errors in Test Files**:
   - Fixed incomplete `CategoriesMobileView.navigation.test.tsx` by adding missing code and test cases
   - Fixed invalid Handlebars-like templates in `SiteForm.submission.test.tsx` and `SiteForm.validation.test.tsx`

6. **Fixed BasicInfoPreview Issue**:
   - Fixed the index file in `src/components/admin/sites/components/preview/index.ts`
   - Made sure components are properly imported before being exported

7. **Refactored Large Test File into Modules**:
   - Split `ZKPLogin.enhanced.test.tsx` into four separate test files:
     - `ZKPLogin.rendering.test.tsx` - Tests UI rendering
     - `ZKPLogin.interaction.test.tsx` - Tests user interactions
     - `ZKPLogin.validation.test.tsx` - Tests form validation 
     - `ZKPLogin.auth.test.tsx` - Tests authentication flow

#### Remaining Issues Identified

1. **NextResponse Mock Issue**:
   - Still seeing errors with `TypeError: Cannot set property status of #<Response> which has only a getter`
   - Need to fix the EnhancedResponse implementation in jest.setup.js
   - Response objects need a different approach for adding json() method

2. **Component Structure Mismatches**:
   - ZKPLogin tests are looking for elements like email input but component has username input
   - Test assertions don't match the actual component structure

3. **Test Data Structure Mismatches**:
   - Some tests expect specific data patterns in `global.__TEST_DATA__` object
   - Need to refine the test data setup to better match expectations

4. **DOM Test Errors**:
   - Many tests fail with element not found errors
   - Test queries don't match the actual rendered component structure

#### Next Steps

1. **Fix NextResponse Mock Implementation**:
   - Modify the EnhancedResponse class to avoid setting properties directly
   - Use getter/setter pattern or composition instead of inheritance

2. **Update Test Assertions to Match Components**:
   - Review failing tests and update selectors/assertions to match actual components
   - Fix data-testid attributes to ensure consistency

3. **Refine Global Test Data**:
   - Analyze test patterns and update test data structure
   - Make sure the object structure matches what tests expect

4. **Continue with Additional Fixes**:
   - Address component-specific test requirements
   - Focus on getting API tests working first, then UI components

Progress has been made, but additional work is needed to fully address all test failures. The SiteForm validation tests are now passing, indicating our approach is working.
