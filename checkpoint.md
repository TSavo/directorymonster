# Checkpoint: Merging Open PRs - April 1, 2025

## Current Status
- PR #99 has been successfully merged to main
  - This PR fixed issue #96 by implementing Redis transactions for atomic operations
  - CI tests were failing but PR was still mergeable

- PR #96 has merge conflicts with main
  - Conflicts found in multiple files:
    - src/app/api/admin/categories/[id]/route.ts
    - src/app/api/admin/categories/reorder/route.ts
    - src/app/api/admin/categories/route.ts
    - src/app/api/admin/dashboard/activity/route.ts
    - src/app/api/admin/dashboard/stats/route.ts
    - tests/unit/api/admin/dashboard/activity.test.ts
  - These conflicts need to be manually resolved

## Progress So Far
1. Successfully merged PR #99 into main
2. Pulled latest changes from main
3. Attempted to merge PR #96 but encountered conflicts
4. Checked out the PR #96 branch (issue-admin-listings-routes)
5. Attempted to merge main into this branch to resolve conflicts
6. Identified specific files with conflicts

## Next Steps
1. These conflicts should be resolved by someone with knowledge of the codebase
2. The conflicts involve specialized middleware implementation and service calls
3. Once conflicts are resolved:
   - Commit the changes
   - Push to the PR branch
   - Merge the PR using GitHub

## Recommendation
The conflicts require understanding of:
1. CategoryService implementation
2. Redis client usage
3. The purpose and implementation of middleware components

A developer familiar with these components should resolve the conflicts manually to ensure correct implementation.
