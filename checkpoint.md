## Current Task: Implement Redis Connection Fallback Mechanism (Issue #12)

### Completed

I've implemented a robust Redis connection fallback mechanism that satisfies all requirements from issue #12:

1. ✅ **Detection of Redis connection failures** - Enhanced with proper event handling and state management
2. ✅ **In-memory storage adapter with Redis-compatible API** - Refactored into separate module
3. ✅ **Automatic switching between Redis and in-memory storage** - Implemented with state transitions
4. ✅ **Background reconnection attempts** - Added with exponential backoff
5. ✅ **Monitoring and logging of connection status** - Implemented with event system

### Implementation Details

1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Reorganized code into smaller, focused modules
   - Created separate files for memory store, connection management, and client interface

2. **Enhanced Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Added proper state machine for connection status
   - Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Added configurable retry settings via environment variables

3. **Event System**:
   - Created event emitter for connection state changes
   - Added subscription API for monitoring connection state

4. **Improved API**:
   - Enhanced key-value interface for easier usage
   - Added connection status methods

5. **Added Tests**:
   - Created basic test suite for fallback functionality

### Testing

The implementation includes tests to verify:
- Automatic fallback to memory implementation
- Basic Redis operations using the memory implementation
- Proper key expiration support
- Connection state management
- Forced reconnection handling

### Next Steps

1. Mark issue #12 as in progress:
   ```
   gh issue edit 12 --add-label "status:in-progress"
   ```

2. Create a pull request with these changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement robust Redis connection fallback mechanism #12"
   git push origin fix/issue-12-redis-fallback
   ```

3. Once the PR is created, add more comprehensive tests if needed

4. After this issue is completed, the next priority issues to address would be:
   - #18: Create Core Multi-tenant Router
   - #19: Implement Basic Category and Listing Management
