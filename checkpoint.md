Working on issue #11: [BUG] fetch API not available in Jest test environment

### Plan:
1. Investigate Jest configuration files to understand current setup
2. Research best approach for adding fetch polyfill (jest-fetch-mock vs. isomorphic-fetch vs. node-fetch)
3. Implement the fix in Jest setup files
4. Test solution by running tests that use fetch API
5. Create PR with the fix

### Progress:
- Created branch `fix/issue-11-fetch-api-jest`
- Marked issue as "status:in-progress"
- Completed investigation of Jest configuration:
  - Found `jest-fetch-mock` is already installed and partially configured in `jest.setup.js`
  - Tests still fail with `ReferenceError: fetch is not defined` error
  - The current setup might not be properly defining global.fetch for all test environments
  - Node v18+ has native fetch support, but the project may be running in an environment where it's not available
  - Tests are running in Jest's JSDOM environment which doesn't have fetch by default

### Investigation:
1. Current setup in `jest.setup.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Enable fetch mocks for the entire test suite
   enableFetchMocks();

   // Configure fetch mock to return empty responses by default
   global.fetch = global.fetch || require('jest-fetch-mock');
   global.fetch.mockResponse(JSON.stringify({}));

   // Mock node-fetch for integration tests
   jest.mock('node-fetch', () => jest.fn());
   ```

2. The issue:
   - Tests still fail with `ReferenceError: fetch is not defined`
   - Some tests might be running in environments where the global fetch isn't correctly initialized
   - The mocking of `node-fetch` doesn't appear to be working correctly

3. Potential solutions:
   - Update the jest setup file to handle fetch for all environments
   - Ensure node-fetch is available in Node environments
   - Make sure jest-fetch-mock is properly initialized

### Next steps:
1. Update the jest.setup.js file to properly initialize fetch for all environments
2. Update the node-fetch mocking approach
3. Test the solution with failing tests
