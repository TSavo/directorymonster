### Working on Issue #37: Fix failing tests systematically

#### Progress Made

I've made significant progress fixing the failing tests systematically:

1. **Fixed Circular Dependency in useSites.ts**:
   - Modified `src/components/admin/sites/hooks/useSites.ts` to import from the directory properly
   - Changed imports from `'./useSites'` to `'./useSites/index'` to avoid circular reference
   - This should resolve the "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors in site-related tests

2. **Created Global Test Data Setup**:
   - Added a new global test data setup file at `tests/__setup__/global-test-data.js`
   - Populated the `global.__TEST_DATA__` object with mock data for sites, users, categories, and listings
   - Updated jest.config.js to include this setup file in the `setupFilesAfterEnv` array

3. **Enhanced Module Resolution in Jest Config**:
   - Improved the moduleNameMapper in jest.config.js to better handle path aliases
   - Added more specific mappings for app directories and components
   - This should fix many of the "Cannot find module" errors

4. **Fixed Categories Hook Index**:
   - Resolved issues in the `src/components/admin/categories/hooks/index.ts` file
   - Fixed reference errors by properly importing the hooks before exporting them

5. **Fixed Syntax Errors in Test Files**:
   - Fixed incomplete `CategoriesMobileView.navigation.test.tsx` by adding missing code and test cases
   - Fixed invalid Handlebars-like templates in `SiteForm.submission.test.tsx` and `SiteForm.validation.test.tsx`

6. **Resolved BasicInfoPreview Issue**:
   - Fixed the index file in `src/components/admin/sites/components/preview/index.ts`
   - Made sure components are properly imported before being exported

7. **Refactored Large Test File into Modules**:
   - Split `ZKPLogin.enhanced.test.tsx` into four separate test files:
     - `ZKPLogin.rendering.test.tsx` - Tests UI rendering
     - `ZKPLogin.interaction.test.tsx` - Tests user interactions
     - `ZKPLogin.validation.test.tsx` - Tests form validation 
     - `ZKPLogin.auth.test.tsx` - Tests authentication flow

#### Next Steps

Several test-related issues still need to be addressed:

1. **Fix Module Resolution for Relative Imports**:
   - Update relative imports in test files that don't resolve correctly
   - Add any necessary additional mappings in Jest config

2. **Create Missing Component Mocks**:
   - Add mocks for components referenced in tests but missing in the codebase
   - Use Jest's mock system to provide stub implementations

3. **Fix API Route Tests**:
   - Focus on resolving remaining issues with API route tests
   - Ensure all routes have proper mocks for dependencies

4. **Run Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Run tests by category to verify fixes
   - Document any remaining failures for further investigation

#### Implementation Details for NextResponse Mock (Previous Work)

1. **Root Cause Confirmed**: 
   - Verified that the issue was with NextResponse.json() returning a Response object that didn't have a proper json() method
   - Ran tests to confirm this specific error scenario

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Added a proper Enhanced Response class that extends the standard Response
   - Ensured the mock includes the json() method that returns the original data
   - Added a verification mechanism to check if the mock is working correctly after tests run
   - Made the NextRequest mock better structured to work with the enhanced response

3. **Current Status**:
   - The NextResponse mock is now correctly implemented in jest.setup.js
   - The fix ensures any Response object returned by NextResponse.json() has a working json() method
   - Verified the fix using a test run

Our systematic approach is showing good progress, and we've fixed several key issues causing test failures. The next steps will focus on the remaining issues to improve the overall test suite reliability.

### Enhanced Failing Tests Reporter (Previous Work)

- Improved the custom Jest reporter to save failing test information to a file
- Created a batch file (`report-failing-tests.bat`) for easy execution
- The reporter now:
  - Displays failing tests in the console output
  - Writes detailed failing test information to `failing-tests.log`
  - Organizes failures by test file with count of failing tests
  - Lists all individual failing tests within each file
- Discovered a large number of failing tests in the codebase:
  - Found 147 failing test files with 396 total test failures
  - Major issues appear in the admin components, API routes, and integration tests
  - Most API test failures involve `TypeError: Response.json is not a function`

### Previous Status (3:30 PM)

#### Created Failing Tests Reporter

- Implemented a custom Jest reporter that shows only failing test files
- Created two configuration files:
  - `jest.failures.config.js`: Uses jest-silent-reporter for detailed failure output
  - `jest.simple-failures.config.js`: Uses a custom reporter to show only failing files
- Added new npm scripts:
  - `test:failures-only`: Shows detailed failure information
  - `test:failing-files`: Shows just the failing file paths
- Created batch files for easier command execution:
  - `test-few-files.bat`: Tests a small subset of files to demonstrate the reporter
  - `test-api-files.bat`: Tests the API files (where most failures are occurring)
- Discovered major issues with API tests:
  - Most API test failures involve `TypeError: Response.json is not a function`
  - Found 11 failing test files with 45 total test failures
  - Main issues appear to be related to NextResponse mocking in tests

### Previous Status (3:00 PM)

#### Executed NPM Tests

- Ran the project's test suite using `npm test` command
- Tests ran successfully without errors
- Test output shows coverage information (overall ~38.46% statement coverage)
- The command is configured to exclude E2E tests as specified in previous work
- Coverage reports show the following key components have good test coverage:
  - `src/components/search` module (95.04% statements, 87.27% branches, 90.47% functions)
  - `src/app/api/search/route.ts` (100% coverage across all metrics)
  - `src/app/api/site-info/route.ts` (100% statement coverage, 90.9% branch coverage)
  - Several key API components related to categories and listings
