## Issue #58: Cross-Tenant Attack Prevention

### Implementation Status Summary
| Phase | Component | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Tenant Context Validation | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 2 | Database/Redis Key Namespacing | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 3 | Tenant ID Protection | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 4 | Authorization Layering | ‚úÖ Complete |
| 5 | Security Testing | üîÑ In Progress |

### Current Focus: Security Testing
We've successfully fixed the `secure-tenant-permission-middleware.test.ts` test suite. All tests in this file now pass, showing proper validation of the middleware functionality. The next step is to fix the remaining middleware test files:

1. `secure-tenant-context.test.ts`
2. `tenant-context.test.ts`
3. `tenant-validation.test.ts`

Key issues to address:
- Buffer response body handling
- Mocking implementation for service functions
- Proper enum access for ResourceType and Permission
- JWT verification and UUID validation mocks

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining middleware test files
2. Run comprehensive tests to verify full tenant isolation
3. Document security architecture and protection measures
4. Update issue status when all tests pass
5. Complete security documentation

## Security Architecture Strengths
- Comprehensive tenant context validation on every request
- Strict UUID-based tenant identifiers with validation
- Cross-tenant access detection throughout request lifecycle
- Deeply nested security checks in request body content
- Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers

## Remaining Work
1. Complete test fixes for all middleware components
2. Finalize security documentation for developers
3. Add cross-tenant attack test scenarios
