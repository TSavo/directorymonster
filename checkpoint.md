# Checkpoint: Incremental Resolution of PR #96 - April 1, 2025

## Current Status
- PR #99 has been successfully merged to main
  - This PR fixed issue #96 by implementing Redis transactions for atomic operations
  - CI tests were failing but PR was still mergeable

- PR #96 was reopened but still has merge conflicts with main
  - Created a new branch 'fix/merge-issue-96-categories-route' based on main
  - Created a new PR #100 to incrementally resolve the conflicts
  
- Files successfully resolved (4 of 6):
  - ✅ src/app/api/admin/categories/route.ts
  - ✅ src/app/api/admin/categories/[id]/route.ts
  - ✅ src/app/api/admin/categories/reorder/route.ts
  - ✅ src/app/api/admin/dashboard/activity/route.ts
  
- Files still pending resolution (2 of 6):
  - ⬜ src/app/api/admin/dashboard/stats/route.ts
  - ⬜ tests/unit/api/admin/dashboard/activity.test.ts

## Progress So Far
1. Successfully merged PR #99 into main
2. Reopened PR #96 which still had conflicts
3. Created new branch 'fix/merge-issue-96-categories-route' from main
4. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/categories/route.ts
   - Kept CategoryService implementation from main
   - Maintained documentation style from PR #96
5. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/categories/[id]/route.ts
   - Used CategoryService implementation from main
   - Enhanced documentation with details from PR #96
6. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/categories/reorder/route.ts
   - Added CategoryService for reordering categories
   - Replaced direct Redis operations with CategoryService methods
   - Maintained audit logging functionality
   - Combined best documentation from both versions
7. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/dashboard/activity/route.ts
   - Enhanced documentation with more detailed parameter descriptions
   - Kept implementation the same (identical in both versions)
8. Created PR #100 with the resolved files
9. Updated PR #100 description to reflect all four resolved files

## Resolution Approach
For each conflicted file:
1. Get the PR #96 version of the file
2. Get the main branch version of the file
3. Merge the implementations, generally preferring:
   - CategoryService usage from main
   - Documentation style and detail from PR #96
   - Proper error handling and tenant validation
   - Avoiding direct Redis operations where possible

## Next Steps
1. Continue resolving conflicts in the remaining files:
   - Next: src/app/api/admin/dashboard/stats/route.ts
   - Finally: tests/unit/api/admin/dashboard/activity.test.ts
2. Once all conflicts are resolved in PR #100:
   - Merge PR #100 into main
   - Update the PR #96 branch with the changes from main
   - Finally merge PR #96

## Recommendation
This incremental approach allows for systematic resolution of conflicts, making the process more manageable and reviewable than trying to resolve all conflicts at once.
