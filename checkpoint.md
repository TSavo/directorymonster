# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - March 30, 2025

Completed testing PR #32 which implements basic search functionality:

1. **PR #32: Implement basic search functionality**
   - Addresses issue #24
   - Adds enhanced search API with filtering capabilities
   - Implements search filtering UI components
   - Includes pagination and sorting features

## Test Results

### Component & API Tests: ✅ PASS
- **SearchResults.test.tsx**: 4/4 tests passing
  - Shows loading state initially
  - Applies filter for category and updates API request
  - Handles pagination with the new API response format
  - Handles API errors gracefully
- **SearchFilters.test.tsx**: 7/7 tests passing
- **search/index.test.ts**: 1/1 test passing
- **API Tests (search.test.ts)**: 7/7 tests passing
  - Returns error when siteId is missing
  - Returns error when no search criteria provided
  - Returns error when query is too short
  - Handles query with category filter correctly
  - Handles featured filter correctly
  - Handles pagination parameters correctly
  - Handles search errors gracefully

### Library Tests: ⚠️ PARTIALLY FAILING
- **category-indexer.test.ts**: ✅ PASS (Good coverage: 83.95% statements, 86.66% branches)
- **search-indexer.test.ts**: ❌ FAIL (9 tests failed)
  - Issues with mock instances
  - Multiple "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- **utils.test.ts**: ❌ FAIL (1 test failed)
  - Issue with NaN when calculating search score
- **listing-indexer.test.ts**: ❌ FAIL (2 tests failed)
  - Cannot read properties of undefined for id
  - Issue with Redis mocking

## Next Steps

1. Fix the failing tests in the search library:
   - Correct the mocking setup in search-indexer tests
   - Fix the score calculation in utils.test.ts
   - Address undefined properties in listing-indexer tests
2. Rerun tests after fixes
3. Update PR #32 with test fixes
4. Ensure all tests pass before approving merge

The frontend components and API endpoints are working correctly, but the backend library implementation needs some adjustments before the PR can be merged.
