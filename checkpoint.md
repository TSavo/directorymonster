# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - March 30, 2025

Investigating failing tests in PR #33 related to issue #9:

1. **Issue #9: Complete Implementation of Incomplete useListings Hook**
   - Confirmed that the `setSearchTerm` function in `useListings.ts` is properly implemented
   - PR #33 was created to update documentation about this finding
   - PR tests are failing (both coverage-tests and docker-tests)
   - PR makes significant changes to test files that may be causing failures

2. **PR #33 Analysis**
   - The PR significantly modifies test files:
     - Removes Jest fetch mock configuration in jest.setup.js
     - Updates test expectations and implementations in several test files
     - Changes mocking approach in search-indexer.test.ts
   - These changes are likely causing the test failures

## Action Plan

1. Address failing tests in PR #33:
   - Restore the fetch mocking configuration in jest.setup.js
   - Review and fix changed test expectations
   - Keep documentation updates related to issue #9
   - Avoid making unrelated test changes for this PR

2. Steps to complete:
   - Checkout PR branch and review failing tests in detail
   - Run tests locally to identify specific failures
   - Make minimal changes to fix test failures
   - Commit and push updates to the PR branch
   - Request review once tests are passing

3. Future work:
   - Return to addressing integration test failures in PR #32 as noted in previous checkpoint
   - Separate test refactoring into a dedicated PR if needed

This is a focused plan to address the immediate issue with PR #33 while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
