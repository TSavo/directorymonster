## Current Status - Test Coverage Improvement Phase 3 - API Testing âœ…

We're continuing our work on Phase 3 of the test coverage improvement efforts, specifically focusing on implementing tests for the remaining API endpoints. Today we'll be completing the API endpoint testing portion of Phase 3 by implementing tests for the categories, site-info, and site-specific API endpoints.

### Completed Tasks

1. **CI Implementation**:
   - Fixed failing tests in the CI workflow
   - Optimized CI configuration for better performance
   - Fixed CI compatibility issues
   - Validated CI functionality
   - Added comprehensive documentation

2. **Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 1)**:
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for ListingCard.tsx component
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for SiteHeader.tsx component
   - Implemented proper mocking strategies for dependencies
   - Added tests for conditional rendering scenarios
   - Added tests for SEO elements and Schema.org markup

3. **Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 2)**:
   - Reviewed existing site-utils.test.ts for completeness
   - Created comprehensive tests for redis-client.ts
     - Tested in-memory Redis implementation
     - Tested key-value operations (get, set, delete)
     - Tested set operations (sadd, srem, smembers, sinter)
     - Tested pattern-based key searching
     - Tested transaction support
     - Tested simplified KV interface
   - Created comprehensive tests for redis-health.ts
     - Tested successful connection scenarios
     - Tested various error conditions
     - Tested error handling

4. **Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 3 - Partially Completed)**:
   - Implemented tests for `/api/healthcheck` endpoint
     - Tested healthy and unhealthy states
     - Tested response structure and status codes
     - Tested environment variable handling
   - Implemented tests for `/api/search` endpoint
     - Tested query validation
     - Tested search results format
     - Tested error handling
     - Tested site-specific search filtering
   - Implemented tests for `/api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings` endpoint
     - Tested GET endpoint for retrieving listings
     - Tested POST endpoint for creating listings
     - Tested validation rules
     - Tested error handling
     - Tested Redis transaction handling
     - Tested search indexing integration
   - Tested API middleware (withRedis)

### Current Work - Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 3 - Remaining API Endpoints)

Today's focus is on completing the API endpoint testing by implementing tests for the remaining three API endpoints:

1. **Categories API Endpoint**:
   - Test file: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\categories.test.ts`
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\categories\route.ts`
   - Testing both GET and POST functionality
   - Testing validation rules
   - Testing error handling
   - Testing Redis operations

2. **Site Info API Endpoint**:
   - Test file: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\site-info.test.ts`
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\site-info\route.ts` 
   - Testing site information retrieval
   - Testing domain-based site resolution
   - Testing error handling

3. **Site-specific API Endpoint**:
   - Test file: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\site.test.ts`
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\route.ts`
   - Testing site configuration retrieval and updates
   - Testing authorization checks
   - Testing validation rules

### Testing Approach

For each API endpoint, we'll follow this structured approach:

1. **Understanding the API Logic**: Review the source code to understand the functionality
2. **Testing Success Paths**: Verify expected behavior with valid inputs
3. **Testing Error Paths**: Verify error handling with invalid inputs 
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Verify behavior with edge case inputs
5. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Use mocks for Redis and other external dependencies
6. **Testing Authorization**: Verify proper authorization checks where applicable

### Next Steps (After API Testing Completion)

1. **Begin Integration Testing (Phase 4)**:
   - Create integration test directory
   - Implement tests for critical user flows
   - Test multitenancy and site isolation

2. **Docker Integration (Phase 5)**:
   - Reintroduce Docker-based testing
   - Add container health checking
   - Implement Docker-specific tests

### Timeline

- Complete API Endpoint Testing: Today (March 27, 2025)
- Begin Integration Testing (Phase 4): Next week
- Docker Integration (Phase 5): Following week

With the completion of these API tests, we will have substantially improved the test coverage for critical backend functionality, moving closer to our target of 70-80% test coverage.
