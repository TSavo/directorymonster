## Sprint Plan - Admin MVP Completion

After reviewing the existing site management components, I found that many of the required components are already implemented but need to be integrated into a cohesive workflow. Here's what I found:

### Sites Management Implementation Plan

#### 1. Existing Components Assessment

**Core Components:**
- ‚úÖ SiteForm.tsx - Basic implementation exists but needs to be converted to multi-step
- ‚úÖ DomainManager.tsx - Fully implemented component for domain management
- ‚úÖ SiteSettings.tsx - Comprehensive settings implementation
- ‚úÖ SEOSettings.tsx - Complete SEO configuration component

**Hooks:**
- ‚úÖ useDomains.ts - Complete implementation for domain management
- ‚ùå useSites.ts - Missing comprehensive site management hook

**Missing Components:**
- ‚ùå BasicInfoStep.tsx - Need to extract from SiteForm
- ‚ùå ThemeStep.tsx - Need to extract from SiteSettings
- ‚ùå SiteFormPreview.tsx - Need to implement
- ‚ùå All table components - Need to implement (SiteTable, SiteTableRow, etc.)
- ‚ùå All mobile components - Need to implement

#### 2. Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Create Multi-step Form**
- Refactor SiteForm.tsx into container with step navigation
- Extract BasicInfoStep from existing SiteForm
- Connect DomainManager as DomainStep
- Extract ThemeStep from SiteSettings
- Use existing SEOSettings as SEOStep
- Create SiteFormPreview component

**Step 2: Develop SiteTable Components**
- Create SiteTable.tsx container component
- Implement SiteTableRow for individual sites
- Add SiteTableHeader for search/filtering
- Add standard components (Error, Skeleton, EmptyState)

**Step 3: Mobile Components**
- Create SiteMobileView container
- Implement card components for mobile

**Step 4: Implement Support Files**
- Create useSites.ts hook for CRUD operations
- Implement validation and utility functions

### Testing & Documentation Plan
- Add tests for each component:
  - Basic rendering tests
  - Interaction tests
  - Mobile responsiveness tests
  - Accessibility tests
- Document the implementation pattern in a README.md in the sites component folder
- Update admin MVP documentation

### Next Steps
1. Start with basic component structure and folder organization
2. Implement core SiteForm and steps first
3. Create SiteTable components with data fetching
4. Add mobile views
5. Create tests and documentation
