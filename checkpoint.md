## Current Task: Implement Redis Connection Fallback Mechanism (Issue #12)

### Completed

I've implemented a robust Redis connection fallback mechanism that satisfies all requirements from issue #12:

1. ✅ **Detection of Redis connection failures** - Enhanced with proper event handling and state management
2. ✅ **In-memory storage adapter with Redis-compatible API** - Refactored into separate module
3. ✅ **Automatic switching between Redis and in-memory storage** - Implemented with state transitions
4. ✅ **Background reconnection attempts** - Added with exponential backoff
5. ✅ **Monitoring and logging of connection status** - Implemented with event system

### Implementation Details

1. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Reorganized code into smaller, focused modules
   - Created separate files for memory store, connection management, and client interface

2. **Enhanced Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Added proper state machine for connection status
   - Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Added configurable retry settings via environment variables

3. **Event System**:
   - Created event emitter for connection state changes
   - Added subscription API for monitoring connection state

4. **Improved API**:
   - Enhanced key-value interface for easier usage
   - Added connection status methods

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created dedicated test files for each component:
     - `memory-store.test.ts`: Tests for the in-memory Redis implementation
     - `connection-manager.test.ts`: Tests for connection management functionality
     - `client.test.ts`: Tests for the Redis client interface
     - `redis-cache.test.ts`: Tests for the caching layer
     - `redis-health.test.ts`: Tests for health check functionality
     - `reconnection.test.ts`: Tests for the reconnection mechanism
     - `integration.test.ts`: End-to-end tests for all components working together

### Completed Actions

1. ✅ Created a branch for the issue: `fix/issue-12-redis-fallback`
2. ✅ Marked issue #12 as in-progress
3. ✅ Implemented the Redis connection fallback mechanism
4. ✅ Created extensive unit tests for each component
5. ✅ Added integration tests to verify all parts work together
6. ✅ Committed and pushed the changes
7. ✅ Created a pull request (#20)
