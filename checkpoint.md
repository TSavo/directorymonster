### Next Steps
1. ðŸš§ Enhanced Categories E2E test debugging (Priority: High)
   - Added extensive debugging capabilities to the categories E2E test
   - Created HTML dumps directory for capturing page state at critical points
   - Implemented detailed DOM element inspection for UI analysis
   - Enhanced first-user setup handling with flexible form detection
   - Extended timeouts and added retry mechanisms
   - Added comprehensive error logging and recovery strategies
   - Structured test flow with clearer separation of concerns
   
   **Analysis of Current Issue:**
   - The test is now equipped with robust debugging tools
   - HTML dumps will provide insight into what's actually rendered on the page
   - First-user setup is now properly handled with adaptive form interaction
   - We can identify the exact point of failure with detailed DOM structure analysis
   - Selector strategies have been enhanced to detect category elements
   
   **Next Action Items:**
   - Run the enhanced test and analyze the HTML dumps
   - Examine API request logs for error responses
   - Verify seeded data in Redis is correctly accessible
   - Update selectors based on actual HTML structure
   - Implement wait-for-content approach instead of fixed delays

2. ðŸš§ Implement E2E test for listings management (Priority: Medium)
   - Create a Puppeteer-based E2E test for the listings management functionality
   - Test creating, editing, and deleting listings
   - Verify category relationships for listings
   - Test validation and error handling
   - Implement comprehensive test coverage

3. ðŸš§ Fix Homepage Test issues (Priority: Medium)
   - Update title expectations to be more flexible

### Latest Update - [2025-03-29]

1. âœ… Enhanced debugging capabilities for Categories E2E test
   - Implemented comprehensive HTML dumps to analyze page content at critical points
   - Added detailed DOM structure inspection for UI elements detection
   - Improved first-user setup handling with adaptive form detection
   - Enhanced error recovery strategies and retry mechanisms
   - Added dedicated debugging scripts (run-categories-debug.sh/bat) for convenience
   - Extended timeouts and improved logging

2. âœ… Created convenience scripts for running debug-enabled tests
   - Added `run-categories-debug.sh` for Unix/Mac/Linux environments
   - Added `run-categories-debug.bat` for Windows environments
   - Scripts clear previous logs, set up environment variables, and provide summary reports
   - Logs are saved to dedicated directories for easier analysis

3. ðŸ”” Current Action Plan: Run and fix Categories E2E Test
   I'll be executing the following steps to run the enhanced categories E2E test:

   1. **Run the test with debugging enabled**
      - Execute `run-categories-debug.bat` on Windows
      - This will clear previous logs and run with enhanced debugging
   
   2. **Analyze the generated debug artifacts**
      - Examine HTML dumps to see the actual page content at critical points
      - Check DOM element details to understand what selectors are/aren't matching
      - Look for API endpoints being called and potential error responses
      - Check console logs for JavaScript errors or navigation issues
   
   3. **Update test implementation based on findings**
      - If the issue is with selectors: Update selector strategies in categories.test.js
      - If there are timing issues: Improve wait mechanisms
      - If there are API/data issues: Verify seeded data in Redis
      - If there are first-user setup problems: Enhance setup handling logic

   4. **Retry test with fixes**
      - Run the test again after implementing fixes
      - Compare before/after results to validate improvements
      - Document any remaining issues for further iteration
