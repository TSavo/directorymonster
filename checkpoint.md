### Fixing Server Error with Redis

I've identified and fixed the 500 error that was occurring due to Redis client issues.

The problem was that the middleware was trying to use the TenantService, which depends on Redis, but there was an issue with the Redis client initialization that was causing a "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charCodeAt')" error.

#### Fixes implemented:

1. Created a new tenant-service.ts file with robust error handling and memory fallback
2. Updated redis-client.ts to better handle import errors and edge runtime environments
3. Modified middleware.ts to use a safe import pattern for the TenantService
4. Added additional error handling throughout the Redis client to prevent uncaught exceptions

These changes should make the application more resilient to Redis connection issues and ensure it can still operate in a degraded mode even when Redis is unavailable or throwing errors.

### Next Steps

1. Test the changes by running the service and ensuring the middleware works correctly
2. Continue working on the original issue #37 to fix the failing tests systematically
3. Focus on implementing the proper NextResponse mock to address the test failures
4. Consider applying similar resilience patterns to other Redis-dependent code

Once the server is running without errors, I'll proceed with fixing the test environment by properly mocking NextResponse as outlined in the PR #39.
