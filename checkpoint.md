# Checkpoint: Implementing PermissionGuard Component for ACL System

## Current Status
I'm working on Issue #57: Implement PermissionGuard Component. This is part of the ongoing ACL system enhancement for DirectoryMonster.

Previous work completed:
- TenantGuard Component implementation (PR #54)
- hasPermissionInTenant function implementation (PR #53)
- Multi-tenant ACL system foundation (PR #47)

## Implementation Progress

I've completed the implementation of:

1. ✅ PermissionGuard component with the following features:
   - Single permission checks
   - Multiple permission checks (any/all logic)
   - Resource-specific permission checks
   - Custom fallback content
   - Silent mode option
   - Loading state handling

2. ✅ usePermission hook with the following features:
   - Current permission state
   - Permission check for specific resources
   - Get accessible resources function
   - Check global permission function
   - Error handling

3. ✅ Comprehensive test structure organized by functionality:
   - Basic permission tests
   - Multiple permissions tests
   - UI behavior tests
   - Error handling and edge cases

4. ✅ Example component demonstrating usage patterns

## Current Challenges

I'm facing issues with the test suite for the PermissionGuard component. The tests are failing with the error:

```
Error: invariant expected app router to be mounted
```

This is happening because:
1. The PermissionGuard component depends on Next.js hooks like useRouter (via useAuth)
2. These hooks expect to be used within a Next.js application context
3. In the test environment, this context is not available

I've started implementing a solution by:
1. Creating a test wrapper component that mocks the Next.js app router
2. Refactoring the tests to use this wrapper
3. Ensuring all necessary context is provided to the component under test

This approach is similar to how the TenantGuard tests are set up, but needs additional configuration to properly mock the Next.js app router context.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the test environment setup for PermissionGuard tests
   - Properly mock Next.js app router
   - Create a comprehensive test wrapper with all required contexts
   - Validate test isolation to prevent cross-test interference

2. Run the complete test suite and verify all tests pass

3. Create a PR for issue #57 with:
   - PermissionGuard component
   - usePermission hook
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Example documentation

4. Begin work on issue #56: Implement withPermission middleware (server-side counterpart)

## Implementation Benefits
The new PermissionGuard component:
1. Provides a clean, reusable way to handle UI permission checks
2. Integrates seamlessly with the existing multi-tenant ACL system
3. Follows the separation of concerns principle with a focused API
4. Complements the TenantGuard component for layered security
5. Offers flexible configuration options for various UI scenarios
6. Includes clear example documentation for developers

## Time Allocation
- Component implementation: Completed
- Hook implementation: Completed
- Documentation and examples: Completed
- Test suite: In progress (resolving Next.js context issues)
