## Current Status - [2025-03-28]

### In Progress
- Creating comprehensive tests for site management components
- Implementing test generator integration with TypeScript
- Adding further error handling for FileSystem operations

### Completed
1. ✅ Installed Handlebars as a dependency
2. ✅ Created HandlebarsEngine.ts to replace the custom Engine.js
3. ✅ Converted form.component template to use Handlebars syntax
4. ✅ Updated ComponentScaffolder.js to use the new HandlebarsEngine
5. ✅ Created a test script to verify the Handlebars integration
6. ✅ Implemented thorough unit tests for HandlebarsEngine.js in HandlebarsEngine.test.cjs
7. ✅ Created a standalone test runner in test-handlebars.js to verify functionality
8. ✅ Converted HandlebarsEngine.js to TypeScript with proper type definitions
9. ✅ Converted Config.js to Config.ts with proper interfaces and types
10. ✅ Converted Template.js to Template.ts with proper interfaces and types
11. ✅ Converted FileSystem.js to FileSystem.ts with proper type definitions
12. ✅ Created TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) for the project
13. ✅ Added type checking test script to verify TypeScript features
14. ✅ Fixed major TypeScript errors in core modules:
    - Fixed 'this' context issues in HandlebarsEngine.ts by using arrow functions
    - Fixed return type issues in Config.ts with proper type casting
    - Fixed array typing in Template.ts with explicit type annotations
15. ✅ Implemented missing loadTemplate method in Template.ts with proper error handling
16. ✅ Implemented comprehensive tests for SiteForm component using testing best practices
17. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in core modules to enable proper compilation
18. ✅ Updated module imports to use correct file extensions for ESM compatibility

### Next Steps
1. Integrate test generator with SiteForm component testing
2. Update template engine to work with compiled TypeScript modules
3. Create comprehensive test suite for site management components
4. Implement additional Handlebars template helpers for complex test scenarios
5. Add integration tests for site management features

### Next Steps
1. Implement tests for the remaining template components with Handlebars
2. Convert the other component templates (table.component, modal.component, etc.)
3. Add additional helpers as needed for the template engine
4. Create examples showing how to use the new template engine
5. Test the updated tool with real component generation
6. Update documentation to reflect the new approach

### Recent Completed Items
- Identified issues with the custom template engine
- Successfully integrated Handlebars for template processing
- Created a complete implementation of form.component.hbs template
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for the HandlebarsEngine
- Verified functionality with a standalone test runner script
