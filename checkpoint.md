## Completed Work
1. Successfully merged PR #99 into main
2. Created a new branch 'fix/merge-issue-96-categories-route' based on main
3. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/categories/route.ts
   - Kept CategoryService implementation from main
   - Maintained documentation style from PR #96
4. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/categories/[id]/route.ts
   - Used CategoryService implementation from main
   - Enhanced documentation with details from PR #96
5. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/categories/reorder/route.ts
   - Added CategoryService for reordering categories
   - Replaced direct Redis operations with CategoryService methods
   - Maintained audit logging functionality
   - Combined best documentation from both versions
6. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/dashboard/activity/route.ts
   - Enhanced documentation with more detailed parameter descriptions
   - Kept implementation the same (identical in both versions)
7. Resolved conflicts in src/app/api/admin/dashboard/stats/route.ts
   - Enhanced documentation with more detailed parameter descriptions
   - Added documentation for query parameters
   - Kept implementation the same (identical in both versions)
8. Resolved conflicts in tests/unit/api/admin/dashboard/activity.test.ts
   - No conflicts found - both versions were identical
9. Created PR #100 with the resolved files
10. Merged PR #100 into main
11. Closed PR #96 with an explanatory comment
12. Added missing admin listing routes from PR #96 to main
    - Added src/app/api/admin/listings/route.ts
    - Added src/app/api/admin/listings/[id]/route.ts
    - Added src/app/api/admin/listings/[id]/feature/route.ts
    - Added src/app/api/admin/listings/[id]/images/route.ts
    - Added src/app/api/admin/listings/[id]/verify/route.ts
    - Added tests/unit/api/admin/listings/permission-middleware.test.ts

## Final Outcome
All conflicts have been successfully resolved and the changes from PR #96 have been incorporated into the main branch through PR #100 and direct commits. The codebase now has consistent implementations of:

1. Category management routes with proper middleware and documentation
2. Dashboard activity and stats routes with enhanced documentation
3. Listing management routes with proper middleware and documentation
4. Proper tenant validation and permission checks across all admin routes

The incremental approach of resolving conflicts in a separate PR proved to be effective and allowed for systematic resolution of the conflicts. The missing listing routes were then added directly to main to complete the implementation of issue #96.
