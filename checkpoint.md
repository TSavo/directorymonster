### Completed Tasks - [2025-03-29]
1. ‚úÖ Successfully set up Docker environment for testing
   - Successfully ran `docker-compose up -d` to start containers
   - Verified all containers are running correctly
   - Resolved issues with container dependencies
   - Fixed configuration to enable proper network connectivity

2. ‚úÖ Successfully ran seed script to populate database
   - Fixed seeding script to use port 3000 instead of 3001 in API_BASE_URL
   - Successfully populated database with test sites, categories, and listings
   - Verified data was correctly added to Redis database
   - Fixed issues with TypeScript syntax in seed script

3. ‚úÖ Created E2E test for category management
   - Implemented robust Puppeteer-based test for category management functionality
   - Created tests for listing, creating, editing, and deleting categories
   - Added hierarchical relationship testing (parent-child categories)
   - Implemented flexible selectors for better UI interaction resilience
   - Added enhanced error handling and detection
   - Used delay function instead of waitForTimeout for better compatibility
   - Added detailed console logging for easier debugging

4. ‚úÖ Fixed first-user issue with Categories E2E test
   - Modified the test:e2e:categories script to run first-user setup first
   - Updated the loginAsAdmin function to detect and handle first-user setup page
   - Added logic to properly create the first admin user during the categories test
   - Successfully handled authentication flow
   - Fixed script dependency sequence

### Next Steps
1. ‚ùå Categories E2E test still failing (Priority: High)
   - First user setup now works properly thanks to our changes
   - Test succeeds in login and navigating to the categories page
   - The test still fails when trying to detect category management elements
   - Error: Expected category management elements to be found (true) but got false
   
   **Updated Analysis of Issue:**
   - First-user setup issue has been resolved
   - Test successfully logs into admin dashboard
   - Test navigates to `/admin/sites/fishing-gear/categories`
   - The category interface elements are still not being detected
   - Likely causes:
     1. The category management UI selectors don't match the actual elements
     2. Seeded site data not properly loaded
     3. Redis data persistence issues
     4. API access issues after login
     5. Timing issues - not enough delay for UI to load
   
   **Next Action Items:**
   - Take screenshots of the page at failure points to see actual rendered content
   - Increase delay time for page loading
   - Verify Redis data via direct inspection
   - Check API endpoint access and response data
   - Improve the selector strategies in the test

2. üöß Implement E2E test for listings management (Priority: Medium)
   - Create a Puppeteer-based E2E test for the listings management functionality
   - Test creating, editing, and deleting listings
   - Verify category relationships for listings
   - Test validation and error handling
   - Implement comprehensive test coverage

3. üöß Fix Homepage Test issues (Priority: Medium)
   - Update title expectations to be more flexible
   - Fix navigation detection with multiple selector strategies
   - Implement better responsive detection
   - Replace problematic CSS selectors with more reliable ones

4. üöß Complete Admin Dashboard Test (Priority: Medium)
   - Fix syntax errors and configuration issues
   - Add proper environment variable handling
