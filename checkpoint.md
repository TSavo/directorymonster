# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - [2025-03-29] - Export Standardization

### Completed Work
- ✅ Standardized export patterns in dashboard and layout module components
- ✅ Created verification script to check export compliance across codebase
- ✅ Fixed dual-export pattern in core components (named + default exports)
- ✅ Eliminated try/catch blocks in barrel files causing syntax errors
- ✅ Reduced export-related warnings in Docker logs
- ✅ Standardized auth module components with dual-export pattern (7 components)
- ✅ Standardized category module components with dual-export pattern (5 components)
- ✅ Standardized dashboard subcomponents with dual-export pattern (2 components)

### Current Issues (Verification Report)
- ✅ All components follow the standardized export pattern
- ✅ All barrel files follow the standardized export pattern

### Technical Implementation
- Components use dual-export pattern:
  ```tsx
  export function Component() { /* ... */ }
  export default Component;
  ```
- Barrel files follow standardized pattern:
  ```tsx
  export * from './Component';
  export { default as Component } from './Component';
  ```
- Verification script (scripts/verify-exports.js) provides detailed reports

### Next Focus
1. ✅ Standardized auth module components with dual-export pattern (completed)
2. ✅ Standardized category module components with dual-export pattern (completed)
3. ✅ Standardized dashboard subcomponents with dual-export pattern (completed)
4. ✅ Standardized remaining barrel files (completed)
   - Updated admin/index.ts to follow standard pattern
   - Updated layout/icons/index.ts and added default export to index.tsx
   - Updated sites/index.ts to follow standard pattern
   - Updated sites/hooks/index.ts to follow standard pattern
   - Fixed dashboard/hooks/index.ts that was also missing standardized pattern
5. ✅ Ran verification script to confirm all issues resolved

### Future Work
1. Add automated export pattern verification to CI pipeline
2. Create script to standardize exports for new components automatically
3. Update documentation with export pattern standards for developers
4. Continue enhancing the DirectoryMonster features as outlined in NEXTSTEPS.md

## Current Focus - [2025-03-29] - E2E Test Fixes

### Plan
1. ✅ Restart Docker development environment
2. ✅ Run e2e tests and capture logs
3. ✅ Analyze errors in test output and Docker logs
4. ✅ Fix component syntax errors (focus on mixed arrow function and regular function syntax)
5. ✅ Update any non-standardized barrel files if needed
6. ✅ Verify fixes with verification script and re-run e2e tests
7. ✅ Document findings and update next steps

### Issues Found and Fixed
1. Added "use client" directives to component files:
   - Added "use client" to ActivityFeedItem.tsx
   - Added "use client" to StatisticCard.tsx
   - Added "use client" to useDomains.ts
   - Added "use client" to barrel files that import client components

2. Fixed admin/layout.tsx imports:
   - Changed from importing from barrel file to direct imports
   - Import AdminLayout from @/components/admin/layout
   - Import WithAuth from @/components/admin/auth

3. Fixed default exports in index files:
   - Dashboard module components were not properly imported
   - Fixed dashboard/index.ts barrel file
   - Made sure ActivityFeed and StatisticCard correctly export both named and default exports

4. Verified export patterns with verify-exports.js script

### Next Steps
1. Improve Dashboard component organization
2. Fix remaining e2e test issues (some tests still failing)
3. Add test for export verification to CI pipeline
4. Consider refactoring some components to better support Next.js app router
5. Update documentation with proper "use client" directive usage
