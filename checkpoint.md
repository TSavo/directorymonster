   - Used delay function instead of waitForTimeout for better compatibility
   - Added detailed console logging for easier debugging

### Next Steps
1. ‚ùå Categories E2E test failed (Priority: High)
   - Executed the test using `npm run test:e2e:categories`
   - Test fails at the first step: "Category listing page loads correctly"
   - The page doesn't seem to contain category management elements
   - Error: Expected category management elements to be found (true) but got false
   - All tests fail because they can't find the category management interface
   
   **Analysis of Issue:**
   - Test successfully logs into admin dashboard
   - Test navigates to `/admin/sites/fishing-gear/categories`
   - The category interface elements are not being detected
   - Possible causes:
     1. The category management UI has changed and the selectors in the test no longer match
     2. The category UI is not loading properly
     3. CSS classes or data-testid attributes may have been renamed
     4. The test might be running before the UI fully loads
     5. The fishing-gear site may not be properly seeded or accessible
     6. The backend API for categories may be failing
     7. The test is getting stuck on the first user setup page and cannot proceed
   
   **Next Action Items:**
   - Identified root cause: The categories test doesn't properly handle the first user setup page
   - Need to modify the categories test to run first-user setup script before testing

### Analysis of E2E Test Issue - [2025-03-29]
After examining the code, I've identified the root cause of the categories E2E test failure:

1. **First User Setup Dependency:**
   - The categories test assumes a user already exists and tries to log in directly
   - However, it appears the system is in first-user mode, requiring initial setup
   - The first-user.test.js script successfully handles this by clearing users and creating the first admin
   - The categories test doesn't have this setup included

2. **Missing Test Sequence:**
   - Current test execution:
     - `npm run test:e2e:categories` runs only the categories test
     - Categories test tries to log in without running the first user setup
     - Login fails because it's redirected to first user setup page
     - Test fails because it can't find category management elements

3. **Solution Options:**
   - Option 1: Modify the categories.test.js to handle the first user setup
   - Option 2: Create a dependency between tests so first-user test runs first
   - Option 3: Update the test:e2e:categories script to run first-user test first

### Action Plan - [2025-03-29]
1. **Implement Sequential Test Execution:**
   - Modify the test:e2e:categories script in package.json to:
     ```
     "test:e2e:categories": "npm run test:e2e:first-user && jest \"tests/e2e/categories.test.js\" --testTimeout=60000"
     ```
   - This ensures the first user setup is completed before running the categories test

2. **Improve Error Handling in Categories Test:**
   - Update loginAsAdmin() function in categories test to check for first-user setup
   - Add detection and processing for first-user setup form
   - Add better debug logging to track test flow

3. **Test Execution:**
   - Run the modified test script with proper sequencing
   - Verify the categories test now passes

I'll implement these changes now and verify the test execution.
