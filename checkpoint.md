# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - March 30, 2025

Addressing failing tests in PR #33 related to issue #9:

1. **Issue #9: Complete Implementation of Incomplete useListings Hook**
   - Confirmed that the `setSearchTerm` function in `useListings.ts` is properly implemented
   - PR #33 was created to update documentation about this finding
   - Working on fixing failing tests (both coverage-tests and docker-tests)

2. **PR #33 Progress**
   - Identified that the PR removed fetch mocking configuration in jest.setup.js
   - Restored fetch mocking configuration to fix test failures
   - Added comments to the PR explaining the changes
   - Waiting to see if tests are now passing

3. **Remaining Issues to Address**
   - Check if tests are now passing with the restored fetch mocking
   - May need to review and fix other test-related changes in the PR
   - Focus on keeping documentation updates while fixing the test failures

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the PR checks to see if restoring the fetch configuration fixed the test failures
2. If issues persist:
   - Run tests locally to identify specific failures
   - Make targeted fixes to address remaining issues
   - Consider reverting other test changes not related to the issue #9 documentation

3. Once tests are passing:
   - Request review on PR #33
   - Return to addressing integration test failures in PR #32 as noted in previous checkpoint

This approach maintains focus on fixing the immediate issue with PR #33 while ensuring we don't lose the important documentation updates related to issue #9.
