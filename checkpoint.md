## Cross-Tenant Attack Prevention (Issue #58)

### Implementation Plan

I've created a comprehensive specification in `specs/CROSS_TENANT_SECURITY_SPEC.md` that outlines the implementation approach for Issue #58.

### Key Security Measures to Implement

1. **Tenant Context Validation** ‚úÖ (Phase 1: Completed)
   - Created enhanced API middleware (`withSecureTenantContext` and `withSecureTenantPermission`) that:
     - Validates tenant context on every request
     - Detects cross-tenant access attempts
     - Prevents tenant ID spoofing
     - Logs security events for auditing
   - Middleware is available for use in all API routes

2. **Database/Redis Key Namespacing** ‚úÖ (Phase 2: Completed)
   - Created KeyNamespaceService for consistent tenant-prefixed keys
   - Implemented SecureRedisClient with tenant isolation enforcement
   - Added security audit logging for cross-tenant access attempts
   - Provided factory functions for tenant-aware Redis operations

3. **Tenant ID Protection** ‚úÖ (Phase 3: Completed)
   - Implemented UUID-based tenant identifiers through KeyNamespaceService.generateSecureTenantId()
   - Added UUID validation for all tenant ID operations (KeyNamespaceService.isValidTenantId())
   - Enhanced TenantService to use cryptographically secure UUIDs
   - Updated tests to verify UUID format and security protections
   - Rejected non-UUID tenant ID lookups for added security

4. **Authorization Layering** ‚úÖ (Phase 4: Completed)
   - Implemented multiple security layers (request, service, data, response)
   - Added tenant awareness to all permission checks
   - Updated ACL system to validate tenant context
   - Implemented defense-in-depth approach with multi-layer protections

5. **Security Testing** üîÑ (Phase 5: In Progress)
   - Create tests that attempt cross-tenant access
   - Verify tenant isolation across API endpoints
   - Implement security audit logging

### Current Work: Fixing Unit Tests

I'm currently working on fixing the unit tests for the `withSecureTenantPermission` middleware. The tests are failing with the following issues:

1. **Mock Function Issues**:
   - The Jest mocks for the services are not set up correctly
   - Functions like `RoleService.hasPermission.mockResolvedValueOnce` are not working
   - `detectCrossTenantAccess.mockReturnValueOnce` is not a function

2. **Type Access Issues**:
   - Cannot access ResourceType.DOCUMENT enum values
   - Cannot access Permission.READ enum values

The tests look correctly written but the mocking approach is not compatible with the implementation. I'm going to update the test file to fix these issues.

### Implementation Timeline

The implementation is organized into 5 phases with an estimated completion time of 12 working days:
- Phase 1: Tenant context validation and middleware (3 days) - ‚úÖ Completed
- Phase 2: Database/Redis key namespacing (2 days) - ‚úÖ Completed
- Phase 3: Tenant ID protection measures (2 days) - ‚úÖ Completed
- Phase 4: Authorization layering (3 days) - ‚úÖ Completed
- Phase 5: Security testing and documentation (2 days) - üîÑ In Progress

### Implementation Details

#### Phase 1: Tenant Context Validation
We've successfully implemented enhanced API middleware that validates tenant context on every request and prevents cross-tenant access attempts. The middleware is exported from `src/app/api/middleware/secureTenantContext.ts` and includes:
- `withSecureTenantContext`: Validates tenant context with strict security controls
- `withSecureTenantPermission`: Combines context validation with permission checking

#### Phase 2: Database/Redis Key Namespacing
We've created two key components for tenant data isolation:

1. **KeyNamespaceService** (`src/lib/key-namespace-service.ts`):
   - Provides consistent key construction with tenant prefixes
   - Includes helper methods for common key types (roles, users, tenants)
   - Implements security validation to prevent cross-tenant operations
   - Enables audit logging to detect unauthorized access attempts

2. **SecureRedisClient** (`src/lib/secure-redis-client.ts`):
   - Automatically applies tenant namespacing to all Redis operations
   - Enforces proper data isolation between tenants
   - Logs suspicious access patterns for security monitoring
   - Provides factory functions for easy integration with existing services

Both components work together to ensure proper tenant data boundaries are maintained at the storage level, preventing one tenant from accessing another tenant's data.

#### Phase 3: Tenant ID Protection
We've enhanced the tenant ID system with cryptographically secure UUIDs:

1. **KeyNamespaceService UUID Generation**:
   - Implemented `generateSecureTenantId()` method using crypto.randomUUID()
   - Added `isValidTenantId()` method for UUID format validation
   - Provided proper TypeScript interfaces for ID validation

2. **TenantService Security Enhancements**:
   - Updated `createTenant()` to use cryptographically secure UUIDs
   - Added validation in `getTenantById()` to reject invalid UUID formats
   - Maintained special case handling for 'default' tenant ID for compatibility

3. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Updated cross-tenant isolation tests to use proper UUID formats
   - Added specific tests for UUID validation and tenant ID protection
   - Verified security against common attack patterns (path traversal, injection, etc.)

These improvements make tenant IDs unpredictable and virtually impossible to guess, increasing protection against enumeration attacks and unauthorized cross-tenant access attempts.

#### Phase 4: Authorization Layering
We've implemented a comprehensive authorization layering system that provides defense in depth through multiple security barriers:

1. **Secure Tenant Context Implementation**:
   - Created `TenantContext` class in `src/app/api/middleware/secureTenantContext.ts` with:
     - Request ID generation for complete audit trail
     - Timestamp tracking for security event correlation
     - UUID validation for all tenant identifiers
     - Tenant membership verification on every request

2. **Multi-Layer Security Checks**:
   - Implemented `withSecureTenantContext` middleware that:
     - Validates authentication tokens
     - Performs UUID format validation
     - Detects tenant ID mismatches in URL parameters and path segments
     - Creates audit logs for suspicious access patterns

   - Enhanced `withSecureTenantPermission` middleware that:
     - Leverages all tenant context security features
     - Performs ACL-based permission validation
     - Deeply inspects request bodies for cross-tenant references
     - Recursively scans objects for tenant ID patterns
     - Prevents cross-tenant ACL manipulation attempts

3. **Integration with Existing Security Services**:
   - Connected to AuditService for comprehensive security logging
   - Integrated with RoleService for permission validation
   - Utilized TenantMembershipService for tenant access verification

This authorization layer completes the "defense in depth" approach by ensuring that multiple independent security barriers must be bypassed for a cross-tenant attack to succeed.

## Security Architecture Review

The ACL system has been significantly enhanced with tenant context (Issue #42), but several security improvements are pending:

### Current Strengths
- All permission checks properly include tenant context
- Cross-tenant access detection is well implemented
- Comprehensive audit system for security events
- Redis-based storage with tenant-prefixed keys
- Enforced key namespacing for tenant data isolation
- Cryptographically secure UUID-based tenant identifiers

### Remaining Gaps (Prioritized)
1. **Issue #58** (High Priority): Cross-Tenant Attack Prevention
   - ‚úÖ Implemented authorization layering for defense in depth
   - üîÑ Fix unit tests for security middleware
   - ‚è≥ Finish security testing and verification
   - ‚è≥ Document security architecture and protection measures

2. **Issue #52** (Medium Priority): Tenant membership service
   - Better error handling in user-tenant operations
   - More robust tenant permission checks

3. **Issue #50** (Medium Priority): Role service integration
   - Optimize permission checking
   - Complete role inheritance functionality
