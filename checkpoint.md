# Checkpoint: Implementing PermissionGuard Component for ACL System

## Current Status
I'm working on Issue #57: Implement PermissionGuard Component. This is part of the ongoing ACL system enhancement for DirectoryMonster.

Previous work completed:
- TenantGuard Component implementation (PR #54)
- hasPermissionInTenant function implementation (PR #53)
- Multi-tenant ACL system foundation (PR #47)

## Analysis of Requirements

Based on the MULTI_TENANT_ACL_SPEC.md document and Issue #57 description, I needed to implement a PermissionGuard component that:

1. Restricts UI elements based on specific permissions
2. Checks if the current user has the specified permission in the current tenant
3. Supports resource-specific permission checks via optional resourceId
4. Provides configurable fallback content for users without the required permission
5. Integrates with the existing RoleService/ACL infrastructure

## Implementation Progress

I've completed the implementation of:

1. ✅ PermissionGuard component with the following features:
   - Single permission checks
   - Multiple permission checks (any/all logic)
   - Resource-specific permission checks
   - Custom fallback content
   - Silent mode option
   - Loading state handling

2. ✅ usePermission hook with the following features:
   - Current permission state
   - Permission check for specific resources
   - Get accessible resources function
   - Check global permission function
   - Error handling

3. ✅ Comprehensive tests organized by functionality:
   - Basic permission tests
   - Multiple permissions tests
   - UI behavior tests
   - Error handling and edge cases

4. ✅ Example component demonstrating usage patterns

## Differences from TenantGuard

The PermissionGuard component is more focused than TenantGuard:

- TenantGuard: Primary focus is tenant membership with optional permission checks
- PermissionGuard: Primary focus is permission checking with tenant context assumed

The PermissionGuard is a simpler, more focused component that assumes tenant membership has already been verified, making it ideal for use inside components that are already wrapped with TenantGuard.

## Current Task Status
1. ✅ Analyzed existing TenantGuard component and tenant access control utilities
2. ✅ Reviewed MULTI_TENANT_ACL_SPEC.md for implementation requirements
3. ✅ Created implementation plan
4. ✅ Marked issue #57 as in-progress and created branch
5. ✅ Implemented PermissionGuard component
6. ✅ Implemented usePermission hook
7. ✅ Created organized tests for the component
8. ✅ Created example component for documentation

## Next Steps
1. Commit changes to the branch
2. Create pull request for issue #57
3. Begin work on issue #56: Implement withPermission middleware
   - This will be the server-side counterpart to PermissionGuard for API routes
   - Will need to integrate with existing tenant validation middleware
   - Should support similar permission checking capabilities

## Implementation Benefits
The new PermissionGuard component:
1. Provides a clean, reusable way to handle UI permission checks
2. Integrates seamlessly with the existing multi-tenant ACL system
3. Follows the separation of concerns principle with a focused API
4. Complements the TenantGuard component for layered security
5. Offers flexible configuration options for various UI scenarios
6. Has comprehensive tests to ensure reliability
7. Includes clear example documentation for developers

Once this PR is complete, we should move on to implementing the withPermission middleware (issue #56) which will apply the same permission checking logic to API routes, completing both the client and server-side components of the ACL system.
