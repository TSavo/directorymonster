# Checkpoint: Running Single E2E Test

## Current Status - COMPLETED

I successfully ran the smoketest.test.js E2E test and analyzed its results.

## Test Execution Summary

1. **Test Selected**:
   - `smoketest.test.js` was chosen as it provides basic validation of core functionality
   - The test includes two test cases: page load validation and 404 page functionality

2. **Execution Results**:
   - Both tests passed successfully
   - Test 1: "Page loads and has proper title" ✓
   - Test 2: "404 page works correctly" ✓
   - Total execution time: ~6.12 seconds

3. **Environment Status**:
   - The development Docker environment was already running
   - Docker containers status:
     - directorymonster-app-1: Up (unhealthy)
     - directorymonster-redis-1: Up (healthy)

## Observations

1. **Console Warnings**:
   - Several 404 errors were logged for resources
   - Redis is using memory fallback instead of direct connection
   - The app container is in "unhealthy" state but still working for tests

2. **Test Implementation**:
   - The smoketest is well designed with appropriate timeouts and error handling
   - The test uses a parameter-based approach for site domain: `?hostname=${SITE_DOMAIN}`
   - Screenshot captures are created for debugging (homepage-smoke-test.png and not-found-smoke-test.png)
   - Tests have been made resilient to different page states

## Relation to GitHub Issues

This test execution is relevant to GitHub issue #37: "[CRITICAL] Fix failing tests systematically" which is currently in progress. While this particular test is passing, some observations about the environment could help with the broader issue:

1. The app container health check is failing but functionality continues to work
2. Redis is using in-memory fallback, which might be affecting other tests
3. The test approach that allows for failures but keeps tests running could be applied to other failing tests

## Next Steps

1. **Review Other E2E Tests**:
   - Examine the more complex E2E tests that might be failing
   - Look for patterns similar to what we observed in this smoketest

2. **Environment Health**:
   - Investigate why the app container is in "unhealthy" state
   - Check if the Redis connection issue is by design or needs fixing

3. **Test Implementation Patterns**:
   - Apply the resilient testing patterns from smoketest to other tests
   - Ensure all tests handle potential 404s and in-memory Redis gracefully

4. **Documentation**:
   - Share findings with the team working on issue #37
   - Note the successful test patterns that could be reused
