## Current Status - Test Coverage Improvement Phase 3 ðŸ”„

After successfully completing Phase 2 of our test coverage improvement efforts for utility functions, we are now moving to Phase 3, focusing on API endpoint testing. This phase will include creating tests for all critical API endpoints to ensure proper validation, error handling, and data consistency.

### Completed Tasks

1. **CI Implementation**:
   - Fixed failing tests in the CI workflow
   - Optimized CI configuration for better performance
   - Fixed CI compatibility issues
   - Validated CI functionality
   - Added comprehensive documentation

2. **Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 1)**:
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for ListingCard.tsx component
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for SiteHeader.tsx component
   - Implemented proper mocking strategies for dependencies
   - Added tests for conditional rendering scenarios
   - Added tests for SEO elements and Schema.org markup

3. **Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 2)**:
   - Reviewed existing site-utils.test.ts for completeness
   - Created comprehensive tests for redis-client.ts
     - Tested in-memory Redis implementation
     - Tested key-value operations (get, set, delete)
     - Tested set operations (sadd, srem, smembers, sinter)
     - Tested pattern-based key searching
     - Tested transaction support
     - Tested simplified KV interface
   - Created comprehensive tests for redis-health.ts
     - Tested successful connection scenarios
     - Tested various error conditions
     - Tested error handling

### Current Work - Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 3)

We are now focusing on testing the API endpoints that form the core of the application's functionality:

1. **Priority API Endpoints for Testing**:
   - `/api/healthcheck` - System health monitoring
   - `/api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings` - Listing CRUD operations
   - `/api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories` - Category management
   - `/api/search` - Search functionality
   - `/api/site-info` - Site information access

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Test all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint
   - Verify proper response structure and status codes
   - Test data validation and error handling
   - Test Redis integration with proper mocking
   - Test middleware functionality (withRedis wrapper)

3. **Testing Structure**:
   - Create dedicated test files for each endpoint
   - Mock all external dependencies (Redis, next/headers, etc.)
   - Test successful and error scenarios
   - Test multitenancy features (site-specific data access)

### Test Implementation Plan

#### 1. Testing `/api/healthcheck`:
- Test response structure and status codes
- Test Redis healthy and unhealthy scenarios
- Test environment variables and defaults
- Test caching headers

#### 2. Testing `/api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings`:
- Test GET endpoint for retrieving listings
- Test POST endpoint for creating listings
- Test validation rules
- Test error handling for missing sites
- Test error handling for invalid data
- Test Redis transaction handling

#### 3. Testing `/api/search`:
- Test query parameter validation
- Test search indexing functionality
- Test search results format
- Test error handling for invalid queries
- Test site-specific and global search

#### 4. Testing Middleware:
- Test withRedis wrapper functionality
- Test Redis connection error handling
- Test proper headers and status codes

### Next Steps

1. **Complete API Endpoint Testing**:
   - Implement tests for all critical API endpoints
   - Ensure proper test coverage for error cases
   - Verify middleware functionality

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Test interactions between components and APIs
   - Test data persistence and retrieval

3. **Docker Integration**:
   - Reintroduce Docker-based testing
   - Add Docker container health checking
   - Implement Docker-specific integration tests

### GitHub CI Workflow Features

The GitHub CI workflow includes:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - GitHub Actions runner on Ubuntu latest
   - Caching for npm dependencies 
   - Host name resolution for domain-based tests

2. **Testing Process**:
   - Static analysis (linting and type checking)
   - Unit testing with Jest
   - Integration testing for multitenancy features
   - Page rendering tests
   - Complete dependency installation

3. **Logging and Diagnostics**:
   - Detailed logging for all test steps
   - Special handling for test failures
   - Artifact uploads for post-run analysis
   - Proper retention policies for logs

### Priority Order (Based on NEXTSTEPS.md)

1. Increase Test Coverage (Critical) - In Progress (Phase 3)
2. Enhance Developer Experience (High)
3. Implement Deployment Automation (High)
4. Reintroduce Docker-based Testing (Medium)
5. Security Improvements (Medium)
6. Implement Parallel Testing (Medium)
7. Add Environment-Specific Testing (Low)
8. Performance Optimization (Low)

### Timeline

- Phase 3 (API Endpoint Testing): Estimated completion in 1 week
- Phase 4 (Integration Testing): Estimated completion in 1 week
- Phase 5 (Docker Integration): Estimated completion in 1 week

After completing these phases, we should achieve the target test coverage of 70-80% as specified in the project requirements.
