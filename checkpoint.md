## Current Status - [2025-03-29] - Export Standardization

### Completed Work
- ✅ Standardized export patterns in dashboard and layout module components
- ✅ Created verification script to check export compliance across codebase
- ✅ Fixed dual-export pattern in core components (named + default exports)
- ✅ Eliminated try/catch blocks in barrel files causing syntax errors
- ✅ Reduced export-related warnings in Docker logs
- ✅ Standardized auth module components with dual-export pattern (7 components)
- ✅ Standardized category module components with dual-export pattern (5 components)
- ✅ Standardized dashboard subcomponents with dual-export pattern (2 components)

### Current Issues (Verification Report)
- 1 component with export issues (needs dual-export pattern)
- 4 barrel files with incorrect export patterns

### Technical Implementation
- Components use dual-export pattern:
  ```tsx
  export function Component() { /* ... */ }
  export default Component;
  ```
- Barrel files follow standardized pattern:
  ```tsx
  export * from './Component';
  export { default as Component } from './Component';
  ```
- Verification script (scripts/verify-exports.js) provides detailed reports

### Next Focus
1. ✅ Standardized auth module components with dual-export pattern (completed)
2. ✅ Standardized category module components with dual-export pattern (completed)
3. ✅ Standardized dashboard subcomponents with dual-export pattern (completed)
4. ⏳ Standardize remaining barrel files (4 files)
5. Run verification again to confirm all issues resolved
