   - Fixed dependency installation issues in Docker container

### Today's Task - [2025-03-29]
3. ðŸš§ Evaluating Category Management E2E Tests
   - Reviewed code in tests/e2e/categories.test.js
   - Found comprehensive test implementation for category management
   - Test includes functionality for:
     - Navigation to categories page
     - Creating new categories
     - Editing existing categories
     - Creating parent-child category relationships
     - Deleting categories
   - Test includes extensive debug logging and error handling
   - Script is run via `npm run test:e2e:categories` or the debug batch file `run-categories-debug.bat`
   - The test script includes the first-user setup to prepare the environment
   - Ran the test and encountered the following issues:
     - Fixed the syntax error (missing closing bracket) in categories.test.js
     - The first-user setup test passes successfully
     - Login fails with a authentication error - the user's credentials are not accepted
     - Navigation to categories page shows a "404 - Site Not Found" error
     - Site "fishing-gear" referenced in the test is not found in the database

### Identified Issues
1. ðŸš§ Authentication Issue
   - Login fails with "Failed to login - not on admin page" error
   - Credentials (admin/password123456) need to be validated
   - ZKP proof generation is occurring but the server is returning 401 Unauthorized

2. ðŸš§ Missing Site Data
   - 404 error when navigating to /admin/sites/fishing-gear/categories
   - The site with slug "fishing-gear" does not exist in the database
   - Database seeding might not be working correctly
   - Redis database has entries for the site but may not be accessible

### Next Steps
1. ðŸš§ Fix Authentication Issues
   - Check if the first-user setup is properly creating the admin user
   - Verify ZKP implementation is working correctly
   - Log the auth token to see if it's being generated and stored

2. ðŸš§ Ensure proper database seeding
   - Verify Redis connection settings
   - Run the seed script before tests: `npm run seed`
   - Update the site slug in test if necessary based on seeded data
   - Check if the site exists in Redis using the provided keys

3. ðŸš§ Modify test to work with available data
   - Update SITE_SLUG in categories.test.js if needed
   - Consider creating a temporary site during test setup if seeding fails
   - Add additional debug logging to track database state
