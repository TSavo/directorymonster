# DirectoryMonster GitHub CI Implementation

## Current Status - Component Implementation - Search Component

We have successfully completed Phase 4 of our test coverage improvement efforts, including integration tests and admin component tests. The project now has significantly improved test coverage across API endpoints, UI components, and integration tests. We are now transitioning from testing to implementation of missing components, starting with the search functionality.
