# Checkpoint: ACL Tasks Implementation

## Current Status
✅ COMPLETED: Issue #57: Implement PermissionGuard Component
✅ COMPLETED: Issue #56: Implement withPermission Middleware
✅ COMPLETED: Issue #42: Enhance ACL System with Tenant Context

I have completed the implementation of tenant context enhancement in the ACL system (Issue #42). Building on the work from PR #53, I've further enhanced the ACL system to explicitly include tenant context in all permission checks.

### Completed Implementation:
1. Enhanced Resource Interface:
   - Modified the Resource interface in `accessControl.ts` to include a mandatory `tenantId` field
   - Ensured all resource references include the tenant context

2. Updated Permission Functions:
   - Modified `hasPermission` to explicitly check tenant context
   - Updated `grantPermission` and `revokePermission` to require tenant information
   - Modified admin ACL creation functions to include tenant context
   - Added tenant-specific ACL creation helpers

3. Added Multi-Tenant Security Features:
   - Implemented `detectCrossTenantAccess` to identify potential security issues
   - Added `getReferencedTenants` for audit and monitoring purposes
   - Created dedicated test cases for tenant isolation verification

4. Comprehensive Testing:
   - Created new test files for the access control system:
     - `accessControl.test.ts`: Tests for base permission functions with tenant context
     - `roles.test.ts`: Tests for role-based permissions with tenant context
     - `tenantAccessControl.test.ts`: Tests for tenant-specific access control helpers

### Implementation Details:

The core enhancements ensure that:
1. All permission checks include explicit tenant context
2. Permissions are properly scoped to specific tenants
3. Users can have different permissions in different tenants
4. Cross-tenant access attempts can be detected and prevented
5. Role-based permissions continue to work with the tenant context
6. Global roles (like SuperAdmin) can operate across tenants when needed

### Security Improvements:

The tenant context enhancements improve security by:
1. Ensuring strict tenant isolation in the permission system
2. Adding explicit tenant validation in all access control functions
3. Providing tools to detect and prevent cross-tenant access attempts
4. Maintaining the "defense in depth" principle by validating tenant context at multiple layers

### Next Steps:

Now that the ACL system enhancements are complete, we can move on to:
1. Issue #52: Complete Tenant Membership Service ACL Integration
2. Issue #50: Enhance Role Service Integration with ACL
3. Issue #58: Implement Cross-Tenant Attack Prevention

I recommend focusing on Issue #58 next since it's marked as high priority and builds directly on the work we've just completed.
