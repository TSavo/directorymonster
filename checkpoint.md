# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - [2025-03-29] - Export Standardization

### Completed Work
- ✅ Standardized export patterns in dashboard and layout module components
- ✅ Created verification script to check export compliance across codebase
- ✅ Fixed dual-export pattern in core components (named + default exports)
- ✅ Eliminated try/catch blocks in barrel files causing syntax errors
- ✅ Reduced export-related warnings in Docker logs

### Current Issues (Verification Report)
- 15 components with export issues (mostly missing either named or default exports)
- 7 barrel files with incorrect export patterns
- Auth module components (7) missing default exports
- Category module components (5) missing named exports
- Remaining dashboard subcomponents (2) missing named exports

### Technical Implementation
- Components use dual-export pattern:
  ```tsx
  export function Component() { /* ... */ }
  export default Component;
  ```
- Barrel files follow standardized pattern:
  ```tsx
  export * from './Component';
  export { default as Component } from './Component';
  ```
- Verification script (scripts/verify-exports.js) provides detailed reports

### Next Focus
1. Fix auth module components (highest priority - 7 components)
2. Update category module components (5 components)
3. Complete dashboard subcomponents (2 components)
4. Standardize remaining barrel files (7 files)
5. Run verification again to confirm all issues resolved
