# DirectoryMonster GitHub CI Implementation

## Current Status - Running Comprehensive Test Suite

After successfully implementing and optimizing the GitHub CI workflow, we're now running a complete test suite to verify all fixes work correctly. This will help ensure that our CI implementation is solid before final deployment.

### Testing Plan

1. **Comprehensive Test Execution**:
   - Running all test types in sequence
   - Capturing test output to log files for analysis
   - Verifying that the previously failing tests now pass
   - Running tests with the Docker environment already active

2. **Test Categories Being Run**:
   - Unit tests (including the fixed multitenant integration and LinkUtilities tests)
   - Domain resolution tests
   - API tests
   - Multitenancy tests
   - Page rendering tests

3. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - All tests should pass successfully
   - Log files should provide clear evidence of testing completion
   - Performance metrics will be analyzed for future optimization

### Post-Testing Plan

After the test suite completes:
- Analyze logs for any issues or warnings
- Verify that the CI workflow can be triggered appropriately
- Document any discovered edge cases for future improvement
- Consider implementing the future improvements outlined in the previous checkpoint

The results of this test run will provide the final verification needed to consider the CI implementation complete and ready for production use.

## Previous Updates

### Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Failing Tests**:

   - Installed missing dependency (@testing-library/react) for LinkUtilities.test.tsx

2. **Optimized CI Workflow**:
   - Added caching for npm dependencies to speed up installations
   - Implemented Docker layer caching to reduce build times
   - Improved container health checking with retries and proper timeouts
   - Optimized test execution flow for better parallelization
   - Added retention policy for artifacts (7 days)

3. **Added Documentation**:
   - Updated README with comprehensive CI process documentation
   - Improved explanation of the CI workflow benefits and features
   - Added instructions for viewing CI results in GitHub

4. **Checkpoint Update**:
