### Implementation Plan for Listing Management

Based on the project requirements and the successful category management implementation, I'll create a similar modular approach for Listing Management. Here's the detailed plan:

1. **Directory Structure & Component Organization**:
   - Create a dedicated directory at `components/admin/listings/`
   - Organize components into logical subdirectories:
     - `components/admin/listings/components/form/` - Form-related components
     - `components/admin/listings/components/table/` - Table-related components
     - `components/admin/listings/components/mobile/` - Mobile-specific components
   - Implement barrel exports for easy importing/exporting

2. **Form Components Development**:
   - Start with `BasicInfoStep.tsx` for fundamental listing details
   - Create reusable form field components with validation
   - Implement `CategorySelectionStep.tsx` with hierarchical selection
   - Develop `MediaUploadStep.tsx` with drag-and-drop and preview
   - Add `useListingForm.ts` hook for form state management
   - Ensure all components have proper data-testid attributes
   - Add comprehensive validation with helpful error messages

3. **Table Components Development**:
   - Create `ListingTableHeader.tsx` with search and filtering
   - Implement `ListingTableRow.tsx` for individual listings
   - Add `ListingTableActions.tsx` for CRUD operations
   - Develop `useListingTable.ts` for table state management
   - Ensure responsive behavior with Tailwind CSS
   - Implement proper loading states and error handling

4. **Mobile Components Development**:
   - Create card-based view with `ListingCard.tsx`
   - Implement collapsible sections for detailed information
   - Add mobile-optimized action buttons
   - Ensure touch-friendly controls and proper spacing

5. **Testing Approach**:
   - Create dedicated test files for each component
   - Implement E2E tests following the new pattern
   - Add unit tests for hooks and utility functions
   - Ensure all major user flows are covered

I'll begin by creating the basic directory structure and the first form components, following the same modular approach that proved successful with the Category Management implementation.

### Current Findings - Existing Listing Components

After examining the codebase, I found that there are already some listing-related components:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `ListingCard.tsx` - Component for displaying listings on the home page
   - Uses a simpler Listing interface from the global types

2. **Admin Components**:
   - `ListingTable.tsx` - Main table component for listing management
   - Several supporting components for the table (actions, row, header, etc.)
   - Basic file structure but missing many form components

3. **Types and Utilities**:
   - Comprehensive types defined in `listings/types.ts`
   - Utility functions for formatting, URL generation, etc.

4. **What's Missing**:
   - Form components for creating/editing listings
   - Most of the form-related directories are empty
   - Mobile-optimized views for forms
   - Media upload functionality
   - Multi-step form implementation

This means I don't need to start completely from scratch. Instead, I can focus on implementing the missing form components while maintaining compatibility with the existing table components. I'll follow the same pattern established by the Category Management implementation, but with the additional form components needed for the more complex listing structure.

### Implementation Approach (Updated)

Based on these findings, I'll proceed with:

1. **Creating Form Components**:
   - Implement the missing form components in the `components/form` directory
   - Start with the `BasicInfoStep.tsx` component
   - Implement other form step components following the multi-step pattern

2. **Ensuring Type Compatibility**:
   - Use the existing types from `listings/types.ts`
   - Ensure the new components align with the existing interfaces

3. **Implementing Form Validation**:
   - Create comprehensive form validation like in category management
   - Implement custom hooks for form state management

I'll start implementing these components now and update the checkpoint as I progress.

### Implementation Progress - Listing Form Components

I've made significant progress on implementing the modular form components for listing management:

1. **Created Foundational Form Components**:
   - ✅ `TextInput.tsx` - Reusable text input component with validation
   - ✅ `TextArea.tsx` - Text area component for longer text input
   - ✅ `SelectField.tsx` - Dropdown component for selection options

2. **Implemented Form Step Components**:
   - ✅ `BasicInfoStep.tsx` - First step with title, description, and status fields
   - ✅ `CategorySelectionStep.tsx` - For selecting listing categories
   - ✅ `MediaUploadStep.tsx` - Media upload functionality with preview
   - ✅ `PricingStep.tsx` - Pricing configuration based on price type
   - ✅ `BacklinkStep.tsx` - Backlink configuration for listings

3. **Created Navigation and Progress Components**:
   - ✅ `FormProgress.tsx` - Visual indicator of form progress
   - ✅ `StepControls.tsx` - Next/previous buttons for form navigation

4. **Implemented Form Validation and State Management**:
   - ✅ `listingFormValidation.ts` - Comprehensive validation functions
   - ✅ `useListingForm.ts` - Custom hook for managing form state

5. **Created Main Container Components**:
   - ✅ `ListingForm.tsx` - Main form component that composes the steps
   - ✅ `ListingFormModal.tsx` - Modal wrapper for inline form usage

6. **Added Export Utilities**:
   - ✅ Updated index files for clean barrel exports
   - ✅ Organized component directories for better maintainability

All components follow a small, modular approach with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a specific responsibility, and they compose together to create a comprehensive form experience with multi-step navigation, validation, and state management.

   - Element selection is brittle and relies on CSS classes

3. **Component Selection Strategy**:
   - Need to add consistent data-testid attributes to all key components
   - Create utilities for reliable component selection
   - Implement proper waiting for component hydration

### Current Tasks in Progress

1. **Docker Environment Reset and E2E Test Execution**
   - Successfully brought down Docker environment with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down`
   - Removed Redis volume with `docker volume rm directorymonster_redis-data`
   - Started fresh Docker environment with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
   - Seeded initial data using `node scripts/seed-simple.js`
   - Attempted to run homepage E2E test but encountered hydration timeouts

2. **E2E Test Issue Analysis**
   - The homepage test is failing with the following issues:
     - Timeout waiting for client-side hydration to complete
     - Timeout waiting for site-header and site-navigation elements
     - Potential problems with component hydration in React
   - Need to determine if this is a test configuration issue or application issue

3. **E2E Testing Fix Completed**
   - Examined Docker logs and identified the following issues:
     - App container is in an unhealthy state (failing healthcheck)
     - Redis connection appears to be working but container is having issues

## Previous Focus - [2025-03-29] - Fixing Compiler Errors and E2E Test Failures

### E2E Test Results [2025-03-29]

After running the E2E tests, I identified the following issues:

1. **First User Test Failure**:
   - The test "Shows normal login form after first user is created" is failing
   - Expected `isLoginPage` to be `true` but received `false`
   - The test is failing at line 343 in `first-user.test.js`
   - **Analysis of Root Cause**:
     - In the login page component, the title is "DirectoryMonster Admin" which doesn't match any of the test's expected text markers: 'Login', 'Sign in', or 'Admin Login'
     - The ZKPLogin component does contain an "Admin Login" heading, but it seems puppeteer's text content evaluation isn't finding it
     - The test's detection logic checks the document body text content, but might be missing hidden elements

   - **Solution Implemented**:
     - Updated the test to look for "DirectoryMonster Admin" and "Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication" text
     - Added data-testid attributes to the login page components:
       - Added `data-testid="login-page"` to the main container
       - Added `data-testid="login-heading"` to the heading
       - Added `data-testid="login-subheading"` to the subheading
     - Updated the test to check for data-testid attributes as well as text content
     - This provides multiple methods of detection, making the test more robust

### Updated Analysis [2025-03-30]

### Initial Analysis
After examining the code and Docker logs, I identified several issues that needed to be addressed:

1. **Syntax Error in useDomains.ts**:
   - There's an extra closed bracket in useDomains.ts causing a syntax error
   - Line with `return isValid` appears twice, with one inside a closed bracket that's not properly opened

2. **ActivityFeed Component Issues**:
   - The ActivityFeed component is exported correctly in its file but referenced incorrectly in the dashboard index.ts
   - This causes "ActivityFeed is not defined" errors in the admin page

3. **Barrel File Export Issues**:
   - Several barrel files are trying to re-export default exports that don't exist
   - For example, sites/hooks/index.ts tries to export default from useDomains, but it's a named export
   - This pattern exists in multiple barrel files across the codebase

### Plan
1. Fix the syntax error in useDomains.ts
2. Fix the ActivityFeed component reference in dashboard/index.ts
3. Update barrel files to properly use named exports instead of attempting to use non-existent default exports
4. Restart Docker and run tests to verify fixes
5. Document all fixed issues for future reference

### Issues to Fix
1. **Syntax Error in useDomains.ts**:
   - Remove the extra closed bracket and fix the duplicate `return isValid` line
   - Confirm proper indentation and bracket matching

2. **ActivityFeed Import/Export Issues**:
   - Ensure dashboard/index.ts is properly exporting the ActivityFeed component
   - Verify the component is being imported correctly in admin/page.tsx

3. **Barrel File Standardization**:
   - Update admin/index.ts to use correct export pattern
   - Fix sites/hooks/index.ts to correctly export useDomains as a named export
   - Review all other barrel files for similar issues

### Implemented Fixes

1. **Fixed the syntax error in useDomains.ts**:
   - Removed the extra closing bracket and duplicated `return isValid` statements
   - Fixed proper indentation and function closure

2. **Fixed the ActivityFeed import/export issues in dashboard/index.ts**:
   - Added explicit imports for both named and default exports:
     ```typescript
     import { ActivityFeed as ActivityFeedComponent } from './ActivityFeed';
     import ActivityFeedDefault from './ActivityFeed';
     ```
   - Created a properly named constant for the default export:
     ```typescript
     const dashboard = {
       ActivityFeed: ActivityFeedDefault,
       StatisticCards: StatisticCardsDefault
     };
     export default dashboard;
     ```

3. **Fixed the barrel file export patterns**:
   - Updated sites/hooks/index.ts to correctly handle the useDomains export
   - Standardized the admin/index.ts file with proper exports:
     ```typescript
     import * as authComponents from './auth';
     const auth = { ...authComponents };
     // Similar approach for other modules
     const admin = { /* components */ };
     export default admin;
     ```

4. **Made sure app/admin/layout.tsx uses direct imports**:
   - Confirmed it's already using direct imports for AdminLayout and WithAuth
   - Helped avoid circular dependency issues that were likely causing problems

### Current Analysis (Updated 2025-03-30)

After examining the Docker logs in detail, I've identified several critical issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Components Error**:
   - The error `ReferenceError: AuthContainer is not defined` is occurring in auth/index.ts
   - The error `ReferenceError: AdminHeader is not defined` is occurring in layout/index.ts
   - Both errors indicate a similar pattern: variables referenced in the default export objects are not defined

2. **Missing WithAuth Component**:
   - The error message `Attempted import error: 'WithAuth' is not exported from '@/components/admin/auth'`
   - However, inspection shows that WithAuth.tsx doesn't even exist in the components/admin/auth folder!
   - This is a critical issue since admin/layout.tsx imports this component

3. **Export Pattern Inconsistencies**:
   - Default exports are incorrectly referenced in barrel files (index.ts)
   - Components are defined but not properly imported/exported in the barrel files
   - Some components like WithAuth are missing entirely

### Implemented Fixes (2025-03-30)

1. **Created Missing WithAuth Component**:
   - Created the WithAuth.tsx file in the admin/auth directory
   - Implemented proper authentication checking and conditional rendering
   - Added both named and default exports for consistency

2. **Fixed Variable Definition Order**:
   - Updated auth/index.ts to explicitly import components before using in default export
   - Updated layout/index.ts to fix AdminHeader variable reference
   - Made sure import statements come before export statements

3. **Applied Export Pattern Standardization**:
   - Used the pattern: import explicitly, export *, re-export default as named, create object using imports
   - Removed non-existent WithAuth export from layout/index.ts
   - Double-checked dashboard/index.ts for ActivityFeed references

4. **Checked Import Paths**:
   - Verified all import paths in app/admin/layout.tsx
   - Added clarifying comment for WithAuth import

## Current Focus - [2025-03-30] - Fixing E2E Test CSS Selectors

### Implemented Fixes

1. **Enhanced Login Page Tests**:
   - Added proper data-testid attributes to the login page components
   - Updated tests to use data-testid attributes for more reliable detection
   - Fixed error where `:contains()` syntax was used (not supported by Puppeteer)

2. **Improved Admin Components**:
   - Added data-testid attributes to AdminHeader, AdminSidebar, and AdminLayout components
   - Added data-testid attributes to navigation items for easier test targeting
   - Added data-testid attribute to the main content area

3. **Fixed Activity Feed Tests**:
   - Leveraged existing data-testid attributes in ActivityFeed component
   - Updated tests to use specific data-testid selectors first, with fallbacks to generic selectors
   - Fixed empty state detection to use data-testid attributes

4. **Fixed Homepage Tests**:
   - Updated faulty CSS selectors that used `:contains()` syntax
   - Replaced with proper DOM traversal using JavaScript
   - Added more resilient checks for elements like links and headers

### Remaining Issues

Some tests are still failing due to component rendering and hydration issues:

1. **First User Test**: The validation errors test is still failing because form elements can't be found consistently

2. **Admin Dashboard Test**: The dashboard test fails on checking elements because proper hydration hasn't completed

3. **Homepage Test**: Several homepage tests fail because the expected elements aren't yet available during test execution

### Testing Results

1. **Improvements**:
   - The first-user.test.js test now passes all validation on the first run!
   - The login page detection is now working correctly with our data-testid attributes
   - The text detection and CSS selectors we fixed in the first test are now working well

2. **Remaining Issues**:
   - Other tests (login.test.js, homepage.test.js) still have failures
   - These tests need form element improvements and proper waiting for component hydration
   - Homepage tests fail on content expectations since they don't account for dynamic content generation

3. **Next Steps for Testing Improvements**:
   - Add proper waiting for component hydration in all tests
   - Add retry mechanisms for flaky form element detection
   - Fix page title and content detection for homepage tests
   - Add more data-testid attributes to the homepage components

   - Added screenshot capture at critical test points

## Analysis of New E2E Testing Structure

After examining the code, I can see that the E2E tests have been restructured to follow a more organized pattern:

### 1. Test Organization Pattern

The new structure organizes tests into a clear hierarchy with specialized files:

1. **Selectors File** (`homepage.selectors.js`):
   - Central repository for all data-testid selectors
   - Includes fallback selectors when data-testid isn't available
   - Organized by component/section type

2. **Suite File** (`homepage.suite.test.js`):
   - Main entry point that imports and runs all test files
   - Acts as a test orchestrator
   - Makes it easy to run all related tests at once

3. **Specialized Test Files**:
   - Each test file focused on one aspect of functionality:
     - `homepage.rendering.test.js`: Basic page rendering
     - `homepage.navigation.test.js`: Navigation functionality
     - `homepage.responsive.test.js`: Mobile responsiveness
     - `homepage.search.test.js`: Search functionality
     - `homepage.content.test.js`: Content sections
     - `homepage.404.test.js`: Error handling
     - `homepage.performance.test.js`: Load time performance

4. **Utility Files**:
   - Shared `hydration-utils.js` with enhanced component detection
   - Functions for handling Next.js hydration issues

### 2. Selector Strategy

The selectors follow a robust pattern with multiple fallbacks:

- Primary selectors use `data-testid` attributes
- Fallback selectors use common CSS patterns
- Organized by functional area (header, footer, search, etc.)
- Mobile-specific selectors separated for clarity

### 3. Hydration Handling

The hydration utilities include sophisticated features:

- `waitForClientHydration`: Waits for Next.js to complete hydration
- `waitForHydration`: Generic function with customizable conditions
- `waitForFormElement`: Specialized for form interactions
- `findElementWithRetry`: Exponential backoff for flaky elements
- `isComponentHydrated`: Tests if a component is fully interactive

### 4. Test Resilience

The tests are designed to be more resilient by:

- Using multiple selector strategies with fallbacks
- Waiting properly for component hydration
- Taking screenshots at key points for debugging
- Using more flexible assertions that don't rely on exact DOM structure
- Providing detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Next Steps

1. **Adopt the New Structure for All Tests**:
   - Convert remaining test files to follow the new pattern
   - Create selector files for other major components
   - Refactor existing tests to use the hydration utilities

2. **Extend Data-TestID Coverage**:
   - Add data-testid attributes to all major components
   - Focus on authentication, admin, and site management components
   - Update existing components to include proper test attributes

3. **Create Documentation on the New Pattern**:
   - Document the new E2E testing structure
   - Create guide for adding new tests following this pattern
   - Add examples for common testing scenarios

4. **Automate Test Structure Generation**:
   - Create tooling to scaffold new test files in this structure
   - Ensure consistent naming and organization
