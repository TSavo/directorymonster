## Sprint Plan - Admin MVP Completion

With the Listings Management components now complete, I'll focus on implementing the Site Management components next:

### 2. Sites Management Implementation

- Implement multi-step form components similar to listings:
  - BasicInfoStep.tsx (site name, description)
  - DomainStep.tsx (domain configuration)
  - ThemeStep.tsx (visual customization)
  - SEOStep.tsx (meta tags, social sharing)
- Develop SiteTable.tsx for site listing and management
- Implement mobile views for site management

### 3. Testing & Documentation

- Document the implementation pattern
- Update documentation for the whole Admin MVP

### Next Steps
1. Complete remaining listing components and mobile views
2. Begin site management implementation
3. Document E2E testing patterns
4. Update component documentation
