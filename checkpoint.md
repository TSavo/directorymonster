# DirectoryMonster GitHub CI Implementation

## Current Status - Test Coverage Improvement Phase 3 Complete - Planning Phase 4 (Integration Testing) ✅

We have successfully completed Phase 3 of our test coverage improvement efforts, implementing tests for all remaining API endpoints with an improved organization approach. The API test suite now features smaller, more focused test files organized by endpoint and HTTP method. With the API testing phase complete, we're now planning Phase 4, which will focus on integration testing to verify interactions between components and end-to-end functionality.

     - Tested Redis transaction handling
     - Tested search indexing integration
   - Tested API middleware (withRedis)

### Completed Work - Test Coverage Improvement (Phase 3 - Remaining API Endpoints) ✅

We have successfully implemented tests for the remaining three API endpoints with an improved test organization approach:

1. **Categories API Endpoint**:
   - Test files:
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\categories\get.test.ts` - Testing GET functionality ✅
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\categories\post.test.ts` - Testing POST functionality ✅
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\categories\route.ts`
   - Testing validation rules
   - Testing error handling
   - Testing Redis operations

2. **Site Info API Endpoint**:
   - Test files:
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\site-info\get.test.ts` - Testing GET functionality ✅
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\site-info\route.ts` 
   - Testing site information retrieval
   - Testing domain-based site resolution
   - Testing error handling

3. **Site-specific API Endpoint**:
   - Test files:
     - `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\api\site\get.test.ts` - Testing GET functionality ✅
   - Path: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\app\api\sites\[siteSlug]\route.ts`
   - Testing site configuration retrieval
   - Testing error handling

### Testing Approach

For each API endpoint, we're following a structured approach with improved organization:

1. **Splitting Test Files**: Separating tests for different HTTP methods (GET, POST) into individual files for better maintainability and clarity
2. **Testing Success Paths**: Verifying expected behavior with valid inputs
3. **Testing Error Paths**: Verifying error handling with invalid inputs 
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Verifying behavior with edge case inputs
5. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Using mocks for Redis and other external dependencies
6. **Testing Authorization**: Verifying proper authorization checks where applicable

### Integration Testing Plan (Phase 4)

Now that we've completed the API testing phase, our next focus will be on implementing integration tests. We plan to:

1. **Create Integration Test Directory Structure**:
   - Main directory: `C:\Users\T\directorymonster\tests\integration`
   - Subdirectories for user flows, multitenancy, and search

2. **Implement Critical User Flow Tests**:
   - Site identity resolution across different domains
   - Data retrieval and display flow
   - Listing creation and search indexing
   - Category management

3. **Multitenancy Validation**:
   - Test isolation between sites
   - Verify correct content mapping
   - Validate hostname-based routing

We'll begin this phase next week and will continue our approach of creating small, focused test files for better maintainability.

### Timeline

- Complete API Endpoint Testing: Completed (March 27, 2025) ✅
- Begin Integration Testing (Phase 4): Scheduled to start April 3, 2025
- Docker Integration (Phase 5): Scheduled to start April 17, 2025
- Advanced Components Testing (Phase 6): Scheduled to start April 24, 2025

With the improved test organization, we're not only increasing test coverage but also enhancing the maintainability and readability of our test suite.
