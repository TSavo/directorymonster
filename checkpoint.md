   - Extended timeouts for better test reliability

### Latest Findings - [2025-03-29]

1. üîç **Issue with Categories E2E Test File**
   - Ran the enhanced categories E2E test with debugging enabled
   - Found a syntax error in the test file: The categories.test.js file is incomplete
   - Error message: `Expected '}', got '<eof>'` at line 726
   - The file appears to be truncated - it contains only helper functions (like `navigateToCategories`) but no actual test cases
   - The file is missing the closing braces and the actual test implementations
   - This explains why the test immediately fails with a syntax error during parsing

2. üîç **First User Setup Working Correctly**
   - The first-user.test.js test runs successfully
   - All 4 test cases are passing:
     - Redirects to first user setup when needed
     - Shows validation errors for invalid form submission
     - Successfully creates first admin user and redirects to dashboard
     - Shows normal login form after first user is created
   - This confirms that the authentication process is working correctly

3. üîç **Navigation Helper Function Present**
   - The `navigateToCategories()` function is defined in categories.test.js (line 581)
   - This function contains comprehensive debugging and flexible selectors
   - However, no actual test cases are using this function

### Next Steps
1. üöß **Complete the Categories E2E Test File** (Priority: High)
   - Fix the syntax error by completing the file structure
   - Implement the test cases that should use the `navigateToCategories()` function
   - Use the debug information we've learned to create 3-4 test cases:
     - Test for listing categories
     - Test for creating a new category
     - Test for editing an existing category
     - Test for deleting a category
   - Add proper closing braces and test descriptions
   - Make the test file compatible with jest test syntax

2. üöß **Run the Completed Test with Debugging** (Priority: High)
   - After fixing the syntax error, run the test again with debugging enabled
   - Analyze any remaining issues with test execution
   - Check if the categories page loads properly
   - Verify if the selectors are working correctly
   - Debug any API issues or data loading problems

3. üöß Implement E2E test for listings management (Priority: Medium)
   - Create a Puppeteer-based E2E test for the listings management functionality
   - Test creating, editing, and deleting listings
   - Verify category relationships for listings
   - Test validation and error handling
   - Implement comprehensive test coverage

4. üöß Fix Homepage Test issues (Priority: Medium)
   - Update title expectations to be more flexible
   - Fix navigation detection with multiple selector strategies
   - Implement better responsive detection
   - Replace problematic CSS selectors with more reliable ones

### Future Steps

1. üöß Create Site Settings E2E Test (Priority: Low)
   - Test domain configuration
   - Test SEO settings
   - Test general site settings
   - Test image upload

2. üöß Implement CI/CD pipeline integration (Priority: Medium)
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for test automation
   - Configure test reporting and notifications
   - Integrate with deployment workflow

3. üöß Fix test template files (Priority: Low)
   - Fix template syntax in SiteForm and other component tests
   - Address incomplete/broken test files to ensure proper execution
   - Fix issues with test imports in component index test file

4. üöß Integrate performance testing into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated E2E testing
   - Configure performance thresholds and alerts
   - Add test reporting and visualization

5. üöß Continue improving test coverage toward 80% target
