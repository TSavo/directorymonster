14. ✅ Fixed major TypeScript errors in core modules:
    - Fixed 'this' context issues in HandlebarsEngine.ts by using arrow functions
    - Fixed return type issues in Config.ts with proper type casting
    - Fixed array typing in Template.ts with explicit type annotations

### Next Steps
1. Implement tests for the remaining components with manual approach
2. Convert the other component templates (table.component, modal.component, etc.) to Handlebars syntax
3. Add additional helpers as needed for the template engine
4. Create examples showing how to use the new template engine
5. Test the updated component scaffolder with real component generation
6. Update documentation to reflect the new approach
