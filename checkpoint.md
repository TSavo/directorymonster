# Checkpoint: ACL System Enhancement

## Status Summary
Created four GitHub issues to address gaps in ACL implementation for multi-tenant architecture:
- #49: Implement hasPermissionInTenant Function (High Priority)
- #50: Enhance Role Service Integration with ACL (Medium)
- #51: Implement ACL Storage and Retrieval (Medium)
- #52: Complete Tenant Membership Service ACL Integration (Medium)

## Implementation Progress
Created `tenantAccessControl.ts` with the following functions:
- `hasPermissionInTenant`: Core function to check permissions in tenant context
- `hasAnyPermissionInTenant`: Check if user has any of a list of permissions
- `hasAllPermissionsInTenant`: Check if user has all specified permissions
- `getAccessibleResourcesInTenant`: Get resources user can access in a tenant
- `hasGlobalPermissionInTenant`: Check for tenant-wide permissions

Each function includes proper error handling and tenant membership verification.

## Current Task Progress
1. ✅ Created unit tests for new functions 
2. ✅ Exposed functions through appropriate service layers
3. ✅ Created PR #53 for review and merge
4. Continue with remaining issues (#50-52)

## Previous Work: PR Merge and Multi-Tenant Architecture Integration

The following PRs represent significant work on the multi-tenant architecture:
1. PR #48: Implement tenant validation middleware for API routes (resolves issue #44)
2. PR #47: Implement Multi-tenant ACL System (resolves issue #45)
3. PR #41: Fix Redis charCodeAt error and redesign middleware (resolves issue #15)

These components include middleware for tenant validation, roles as ACL collections, and Redis cache layer improvements.

## Component Overview
The multi-tenant ACL implementation includes three main components:

1. **withTenantAccess**: Middleware that verifies user access to tenant
   - Checks tenant ID in headers and validates authentication
   - Prevents cross-tenant access attempts

2. **withPermission**: Fine-grained access control middleware
   - Validates tenant access then checks specific permissions
   - Handles resource-specific permissions

3. **hasPermissionInTenant**: Core function for tenant permission checks
   - Validates tenant membership
   - Checks if any role grants the required permission
   - Supports both global and resource-specific permissions

## Next Steps

After completing the remaining issues (#50-52), we'll have a robust ACL system with:
1. Proper multi-tenant isolation
2. Efficient permission checks
3. Role-based access control
4. Integration with middleware components

Subsequent work should focus on:
- UI components for role and permission management
- Performance optimization
- Documentation for developers
