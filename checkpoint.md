# DirectoryMonster Project Checkpoint

## Current Status - March 30, 2025

Completed investigation of issue #9:

1. **Issue #9: Complete Implementation of Incomplete useListings Hook**
   - Discovered that the `setSearchTerm` function in `useListings.ts` is already properly implemented
   - The function now correctly updates the filters and resets the pagination
   - Added a comment to the GitHub issue noting that the issue has been fixed
   - Changed issue status from `status:in-progress` to `status:needs-review`

2. **Next Task: PR #32 - Search Functionality**
   - Need to address integration test failures in PR #32
   - Component tests (SearchFilters.test.tsx and SearchResults.test.tsx) are passing
   - Integration tests still failing with 404 and 400 status code errors
   - Will need to properly configure the API endpoints in the test environment

## Next Steps

1. Return to addressing the integration test failures in PR #32:
   - Fix the search API endpoints in the test environment
   - Update the mock implementations to match expected behavior
   - Ensure proper test data setup for integration tests
   - Make sure the response format matches expectations

2. Once tests are passing:
   - Update PR #32 with a comment about the fixes
   - Request review
