## Current Status - [2025-03-28]

### In Progress
- Attempting to fix issues with the test generator tool
- Found that the custom template engine is problematic and hard to maintain

### Key Recommendation
After spending time trying to fix the template processing system, I recommend replacing the custom template engine with a standard solution like Handlebars:

1. Handlebars advantages:
   - Well-tested, stable implementation
   - Standard syntax that developers already know
   - Built-in support for iterations, conditionals, and helpers
   - Better error handling and debugging
   - Extensive documentation

2. Implementation approach:
   - Add handlebars as a dependency to package.json
   - Replace the custom Engine.js with a simple wrapper around Handlebars
   - Convert existing templates to use Handlebars syntax
   - Simplify the template loading and processing code

### Next Steps (if continuing with current approach)
1. Fix the component generator tool
2. Generate the SiteForm component
3. Run tests to verify functionality
4. Commit and push changes

### Recent Issues Identified
- Custom template syntax is hard to debug and maintain
- Map operations with complex templates don't process correctly
- Multiple passes required for nested structures increases complexity
- Error handling is limited compared to mature templating engines
