# Checkpoint: ACL System Enhancement with Focus on TenantGuard Component

## Current Status
After analyzing the GitHub issues and project status, I'll be focusing on high-priority ACL-related issues:
- #43: Create TenantGuard Component for UI Access Control (High Priority)
- #42: Enhance ACL System with Tenant Context (High Priority)

Previous work on ACL implementation:
- PR #53 implements the hasPermissionInTenant Function (resolving issue #49)
- Issues #50-52 address other aspects of the ACL system

## Implementation Plan

### For Issue #43: Create TenantGuard Component for UI Access Control
1. Create a React component to handle UI-level access control
2. Implement client-side permission checking that integrates with the backend ACL
3. Add support for conditional rendering based on permissions
4. Write comprehensive tests for the component
5. Document usage patterns for developers

### For Issue #42: Enhance ACL System with Tenant Context
1. Extend existing ACL functions to incorporate tenant context
2. Ensure proper isolation between tenants
3. Optimize permission checking for performance
4. Update relevant middleware and services
5. Implement tests for tenant context functionality

## Current Task Progress
1. Reviewing existing ACL code structure to understand integration points
2. Planning implementation approach for TenantGuard component
3. Will mark issue #43 as in-progress and create a dedicated branch

## Previous Work: PR Merge and Multi-Tenant Architecture Integration

The following PRs represent significant work on the multi-tenant architecture:
1. PR #48: Implement tenant validation middleware for API routes (resolves issue #44)
2. PR #47: Implement Multi-tenant ACL System (resolves issue #45)
3. PR #41: Fix Redis charCodeAt error and redesign middleware (resolves issue #15)

These components include middleware for tenant validation, roles as ACL collections, and Redis cache layer improvements.

## Component Overview
The multi-tenant ACL implementation includes three main components:

1. **withTenantAccess**: Middleware that verifies user access to tenant
   - Checks tenant ID in headers and validates authentication
   - Prevents cross-tenant access attempts

2. **withPermission**: Fine-grained access control middleware
   - Validates tenant access then checks specific permissions
   - Handles resource-specific permissions

3. **hasPermissionInTenant**: Core function for tenant permission checks
   - Validates tenant membership
   - Checks if any role grants the required permission
   - Supports both global and resource-specific permissions

## Next Steps

1. Mark issue #43 as in-progress
2. Create branch for implementation
3. Begin TenantGuard component implementation
4. Regular updates to this checkpoint as work progresses
