# Checkpoint: PermissionGuard Component Implementation - COMPLETED

## Current Status
âœ… COMPLETE: Issue #57: Implement PermissionGuard Component

The component implementation is complete with all tests now passing. I've successfully fixed the test issues by:

1. Moving from an approach using TestWrapper with internal mocks to direct Jest mocks at the module level (the same approach used by TenantGuard tests)
2. Fixing the Next.js router context issues by properly mocking all dependencies consistently across test files
3. Updating how the DOM elements are queried in tests (especially for loading indicators)

## Implementation Details

The PermissionGuard component provides a flexible way to restrict UI access based on user permissions:

1. The component accepts the following props:
   - `resourceType`: The type of resource being accessed
   - `permission`: A single permission to check for
   - `permissions`: Array of permissions to check (for multiple permission checks)
   - `resourceId`: Optional specific resource ID for granular permissions
   - `requireAll`: Whether all permissions or any permission must be granted
   - `fallback`: What to show when permission is denied
   - `showLoading`: Whether to show a loading indicator
   - `silent`: When true, shows nothing instead of fallback on permission failure

2. Key features include:
   - Integration with the ACL system for permission checks
   - Support for both single and multiple permission checks
   - Resource-specific permission checks
   - Customizable UI behavior with fallback and loading states

## Changes Made

1. Fixed test issues by:
   - Removing mocks from test-wrapper.tsx
   - Moving all mocks to the individual test files
   - Using direct Jest module mocks with proper typings
   - Updating loading indicator tests to properly query DOM elements

2. Ensured all tests consistently use the same approach:
   - Mock hooks at the module level
   - Set up standard mock values in beforeEach blocks
   - Override mock returns in individual tests as needed
   - Use consistent DOM queries and assertions

## Test Results

All 17 tests are now passing:
- Basic permissions tests: 4 passing
- Multiple permissions tests: 4 passing
- UI behavior tests: 4 passing
- Error handling tests: 5 passing

## Next Steps

The PermissionGuard component is ready to be merged. To complete the PR:

1. Update the PR description with implementation details and usage examples
2. Add inline documentation to the component where needed
3. Verify any additional code review feedback
4. Request final review and merge

## Lessons Learned

1. When working with Next.js components in tests:
   - Ensure consistent mocking approaches across test files
   - Be careful with router/context dependencies
   - Use TestingLibrary's proper methods for querying elements

2. For flexible UI components:
   - Test all possible prop combinations
   - Include error handling tests
   - Verify visual elements through DOM queries

The PermissionGuard component complements the existing TenantGuard component, providing a complete solution for UI-level access control in the multi-tenant system.
