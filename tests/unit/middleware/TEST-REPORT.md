# Secure Tenant Context Middleware Test Status

## Summary

The unit tests for the Secure Tenant Context middleware have been split into multiple files to improve maintainability and focus. The implementation of the middleware itself is complete, but the test suite has several technical issues preventing the tests from passing.

## Test Files Structure

1. **secure-tenant-setup.ts** - Common setup and utilities for all middleware tests
2. **tenant-context.test.ts** - Tests for the TenantContext class
3. **secure-tenant-context-middleware.test.ts** - Tests for the withSecureTenantContext middleware
4. **secure-tenant-permission-middleware.test.ts** - Tests for the withSecureTenantPermission middleware
5. **secure-tenant-context.test.ts** - Integration tests that bring all components together

## Key Issues Preventing Tests from Passing

1. **Jest Mock Implementation Issues**
   - The mocks for `validateUuid`, `verify`, and other dependencies aren't properly set up with mockReturnValueOnce/mockImplementationOnce functions
   - Error: `TypeError: validateUuid.mockReturnValueOnce is not a function`

2. **NextResponse Mock Inconsistency**
   - The NextResponse.json mock returns an object with a Buffer instead of the expected JSON object
   - The mocked body contains a Buffer with JSON rather than the actual JSON object

3. **ResourceType Access Error**
   - In the integration tests, ResourceType.DOCUMENT access fails with:
   - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'DOCUMENT')`

4. **Test Setup Complexity**
   - The setup required for mocking the complex middleware dependencies is challenging
   - The test environment struggles with the UUID generation, JWT validation, and other security features

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Simplify Mocking Approach**
   - Use Jest's `jest.fn()` approach consistently instead of TypeScript casting with `as jest.Mock`
   - Define mock implementations at the top level instead of in individual tests

2. **Fix NextResponse Mock**
   - Update the NextResponse.json mock to return an object with the expected structure
   - Parse Buffer data to JSON in tests if necessary

3. **Isolate Component Tests**
   - Further isolate each component test to reduce dependencies
   - Create stub implementations for dependent modules

4. **Use a Simplified Environment**
   - Consider creating a test-specific version of the middleware for easier testing
   - Create factory functions for test objects to ensure consistent test data

## Current Test Progress

- 8 passing tests focusing on basic functionality
- 17 failing tests related to more complex security validations
- Main functionality is testable through visual confirmation and manual testing

## Next Steps

1. Create a simplified version of the test suite to verify core functionality
2. Gradually add more complex tests as the mocking issues are resolved
3. Focus on integration testing through the API routes that use the middleware
4. Document the testing approach for future reference
