  "body": "I've completed an investigation into running the integration tests for the FilterReset.test.tsx file. Here's what I found and fixed:\n\n### Issues Identified\n\n1. **Missing Package Dependencies**:\n   - Several Redux-related packages were required but not installed: `react-redux`, `redux-mock-store`, and `redux`\n   - Installed all three packages to resolve dependency errors\n\n2. **UI Component Path Resolution**:\n   - The tests attempt to import from a UI library that appears to use path aliases\n   - Jest configuration has `@/` path mapping but not for specific UI components\n\n3. **Component Mocking Strategy**:\n   - The test uses direct imports of UI components rather than mocks\n   - A more robust approach would be to mock these components for testing\n\n### Fixes Implemented\n\n- ✅ Added missing package dependencies to the project\n- ✅ Updated checkpoint.md and NEXTSTEPS.md with findings\n- ✅ Committed changes to git repository\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. Create mock implementations for UI components used in tests\n2. Update Jest configuration to properly handle UI component imports\n3. Document the required testing dependencies\n4. Create a script for setting up the testing environment\n\nThis investigation has revealed important information about the project's testing infrastructure that will be valuable for fixing the remaining integration tests.",
