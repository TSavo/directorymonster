  "title": "[ISSUE] Integration Test Execution Plan - [2025-03-30 23:45]",
  "body": "I'm going to select an integration test to run and fix any issues. Based on my review of the project files, I've identified some key things to note:\n\n1. **Test Structure**:\n   - Integration tests are organized by feature area in subdirectories (filtering, site-listing, etc.)\n   - Each test file focuses on a specific integration scenario\n   - Tests use a combination of mock hooks and Redux mock store for state management\n\n2. **Import Patterns**:\n   - Tests originally used `@/` path aliases, but have been updated to use direct relative imports\n   - The path pattern is typically `../../../../src/components/admin/[feature]/...`\n\n3. **Recent Changes**:\n   - According to checkpoint.md, all test files have been updated to use direct relative paths instead of alias patterns\n   - Hook directory structure has been created to match the expected paths in tests\n\n### Selected Test: FilterReset.test.tsx\n\nI've chosen to run the `FilterReset.test.tsx` as my first integration test to verify because:\n\n1. It's a good representative example of the integration tests\n2. It has multiple test cases for different aspects of filtering\n3. It integrates multiple components (ListingTable, ListingFilterBar, CategoryFilterTree, SiteFilterDropdown)\n4. It tests a user-facing feature that would be important to verify\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe FilterReset.test.tsx test should verify that:\n- Individual filters can be reset with their specific reset buttons\n- All filters can be reset with a \"Reset All\" button\n- The URL query parameters are updated when filters are reset\n- Reset buttons are only shown when filters are active\n\n### Plan for Execution\n\n1. Run the FilterReset.test.tsx file in isolation\n2. Observe any errors or issues that occur\n3. Fix any problems identified\n4. Verify the test runs successfully\n5. Document what was fixed and any recommendations\n\nI'll update the checkpoint with the results of running this test and any fixes made.\n\n### Test Execution Results\n\nI ran the `FilterReset.test.tsx` test and encountered an error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module 'react-redux' from 'tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx'\n```\n\nThis error indicates that the test is missing the required `react-redux` dependency. This is a package dependency issue rather than a code structure issue.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Missing Dependency**: The test is importing from `react-redux` (specifically the `Provider` component) but this package doesn't appear to be installed or accessible in the project.\n\n2. **Framework Configuration**: This suggests there might be an issue with the testing framework configuration or missing dependency installation.\n\n### Fix Plan\n\n1. **Install Missing Dependency**: Install react-redux if it's not already in the project\n   ```bash\n   npm install react-redux\n   ```\n\n2. **Check package.json**: Verify that redux-related packages are correctly listed in dependencies\n\n3. **Check Jest Configuration**: Ensure the Jest configuration correctly handles module resolution for packages like react-redux\n\n### Test Execution Results - Update\n\nAfter installing the `react-redux` package, I ran the test again and encountered another error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module 'redux-mock-store' from 'tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx'\n```\n\nI'm continuing to find and install missing dependencies. I've now installed:\n\n1. `react-redux` - The Redux bindings for React\n2. `redux-mock-store` - A mock store for testing Redux async actions and middleware\n\nThis reveals that the integration tests depend on multiple Redux-related packages that aren't explicitly listed in the main `package.json` dependencies.\n\n### Test Execution Results - Update 2\n\nAfter installing `redux-mock-store`, I ran the test again and encountered another error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module 'redux' from 'node_modules/redux-mock-store/dist/index-cjs.js'\n```\n\nI'm continuing to find and install missing dependencies. I've now installed:\n\n1. `react-redux` - The Redux bindings for React\n2. `redux-mock-store` - A mock store for testing Redux async actions and middleware\n3. `redux` - The core Redux library\n\nThis continues to highlight the dependency chain required for these integration tests.\n\n### Test Execution Results - Update 3\n\nAfter installing the required Redux packages, I ran the test again and encountered a different type of error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module '../../../../ui/button' from 'src/components/admin/listings/components/table/ListingFilterBar.tsx'\n```\n\nThis error indicates we have a different issue now, not related to missing dependencies but to component imports. The component is trying to import from a UI component library that's not available in the path it's looking for.\n\n### Analysis of UI Component Dependencies\n\nThe project appears to use a UI component library with an `@/ui` import path alias. This alias is likely defined in a webpack, Vite, or Next.js configuration but isn't correctly set up in the Jest testing environment.\n\nThere are a few potential solutions:\n\n1. **Mock the UI Components**:\n   - Create mock implementations of the UI components used in tests\n\n2. **Configure Jest Module Mapping**:\n   - Update the Jest configuration to map the `@/ui` path to the actual components\n\n3. **Create UI Component Stub Files**:\n   - Create minimal stub versions of UI components for testing\n\nGiven that we've already addressed the dependency issues by installing the missing packages, the next step is to address this component path issue.",
