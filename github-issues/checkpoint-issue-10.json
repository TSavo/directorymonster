  "title": "[ISSUE] Component Tests Execution Plan - [2025-03-31 14:05]",
  "body": "I'm going to run all the component tests one by one to verify their functionality. Based on my analysis of the project files, I've identified the following tests to run:\n\n### Integration Test Categories\n\n1. **Cross-Cutting Tests (4 tests)**\n   - AuthorizationBoundaries.test.tsx\n   - DataPersistence.test.tsx\n   - ErrorRecovery.test.tsx\n   - NotificationSystems.test.tsx\n\n2. **Filtering Tests (4 tests)**\n   - CategoryFiltering.test.tsx\n   - CombinedFilters.test.tsx\n   - FilterPersistence.test.tsx\n   - FilterReset.test.tsx\n\n3. **Listing-Category Tests (2 tests)**\n   - CategoryFilteringNavigation.test.tsx\n   - CategorySelectionInListing.test.tsx\n\n4. **Site-Listing Tests (7 tests)**\n   - FilterListingsBySite.test.tsx\n   - ListingCreationWithSite.test.tsx\n   - ListingSiteAssociation.test.tsx\n   - SiteListingCounts.test.tsx\n   - SiteListingDataLoading.test.tsx\n   - SiteListingLimits.test.tsx\n   - SiteSpecificValidation.test.tsx\n\n5. **Site-Management Tests (4 tests)**\n   - SiteCreationBasicInfo.test.tsx\n   - SiteCreationDomains.test.tsx\n   - SiteCreationSEO.test.tsx\n   - SiteSubmission.test.tsx\n\n### Test Execution Plan\n\nI'll run the tests using the following approach:\n\n1. First, run all tests simultaneously using the command `npm test` to see if any tests fail\n2. For any failures, run the specific test file to get more details about the issue\n3. For each group of tests, I'll run them individually to validate they pass\n\nThis approach will allow us to quickly identify any issues with the integration tests while ensuring thorough coverage of all component interactions.",
