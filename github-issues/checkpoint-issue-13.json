  "title": "[ISSUE] Integration Testing for Site-Listing Data Flow - [2025-03-31 02:05]",
  "body": "I've completed implementing the integration tests for site-listing data flow, focusing on making them small and modular with one file per test. Here's what I've created:\n\n1. **Test Files Created** ✅\n   - `FilterListingsBySite.test.tsx` - Tests filtering listings by associated site\n   - `ListingCreationWithSite.test.tsx` - Tests creating listings with site association\n   - `ListingSiteAssociation.test.tsx` - Tests displaying site info in listing details\n   - `SiteListingCounts.test.tsx` - Tests listing counts in site table\n   - `SiteListingDataLoading.test.tsx` - Tests data loading when switching between sites\n   - `SiteListingLimits.test.tsx` - Tests site listing limit enforcement\n   - `SiteSpecificValidation.test.tsx` - Tests site-specific validation rules\n\n2. **Testing Approach** ✅\n   - Created small, focused tests with one testing concern per file\n   - Implemented proper mocking for both the site and listing data services\n   - Tested various aspects of the site-listing relationship\n   - Verified proper data flow between site and listing components\n   - Tested loading states, error handling, and edge cases\n\n3. **Testing Coverage** ✅\n   - Site-listing filtering and data display\n   - Creation of listings with site association\n   - Site-specific validation rules enforcement\n   - Site listing limits verification\n   - Loading states and transitions between sites\n   - Error handling for various scenarios\n   - Accessibility considerations in interactive components\n\n4. **Next Steps**\n   - Add tests for filtering systems across other tables\n   - Implement end-to-end user flows for site creation and management\n   - Update admin MVP documentation\n\n### Benefits of the Modular Testing Approach\n\nBy implementing one test file per concern, I've created a more maintainable test suite that:\n\n- Makes it easier to identify test failures (each file has a clear focus)\n- Improves test run times (smaller test files)\n- Enhances readability (clear test intent)\n- Makes it easier to extend the test suite in the future\n\nAll tests follow the project's best practices from CLAUDE.md, including using data-testid attributes for stable selections, testing behavior rather than implementation details, and proper mocking of dependencies.\n\n### Integration Test Structure\n\nThe integration tests are organized in the following directory:\n\n```\ntests/admin/integration/site-listing/\n├── FilterListingsBySite.test.tsx\n├── ListingCreationWithSite.test.tsx  \n├── ListingSiteAssociation.test.tsx\n├── SiteListingCounts.test.tsx\n├── SiteListingDataLoading.test.tsx\n├── SiteListingLimits.test.tsx\n└── SiteSpecificValidation.test.tsx\n```\n\nEach test file follows a consistent pattern:\n- Clear test description\n- Focused test cases\n- Proper mocking of required services\n- Testing of both happy paths and error scenarios\n- Verification of component interactions",
