  "title": "[ISSUE] Final Assessment - [2025-03-31 14:45]",
  "body": "After attempting to run the component tests, I've determined that a more comprehensive solution is needed beyond simple file fixes. The project appears to have significant structural issues that prevent the tests from running correctly:\n\n1. **Missing Hook Files**: \n   The tests are trying to import hook files like `useAuth` from specific paths that don't exist. For example, the test is looking for `../../../../src/components/admin/auth/hooks/useAuth` which doesn't appear to be in the codebase.\n\n2. **Project Organization Mismatch**:\n   The test files expect a certain project organization (with hooks in separate directories) that doesn't match the actual implementation. The actual component structure may have changed significantly.\n\n3. **Incomplete Mock Infrastructure**:\n   The tests need a more robust mocking infrastructure that can handle the component dependencies properly.\n\n### Recommended Action Plan\n\n1. **Refactor Integration Tests**:\n   Instead of trying to fix individual test files, we should create a new, more maintainable test setup that matches the current project structure.\n\n2. **Create Hook Utility Modules**:\n   Implement proper hook utility modules that can be consistently used across both components and tests.\n\n3. **Consolidate Project Structure**:\n   Adopt a more consistent project structure that separates hooks, components, and utilities more clearly.\n\n4. **Implement Jest Module Mocking**:\n   Create a proper Jest setup that can mock modules without relying on specific file paths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe component tests require significant architectural changes to function correctly. Rather than attempting to fix each test individually, I recommend addressing the underlying architectural issues first. This would involve updating the project structure, creating proper hook utilities, and implementing a better mocking strategy.\n\nThis analysis has been recorded in the checkpoint.md file for future reference.",
