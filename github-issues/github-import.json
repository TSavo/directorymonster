      "title": "[ISSUE] Integration Test Execution Plan - [2025-03-30 23:45]",
      "body": "I'm going to select an integration test to run and fix any issues. Based on my review of the project files, I've identified some key things to note:\n\n1. **Test Structure**:\n   - Integration tests are organized by feature area in subdirectories (filtering, site-listing, etc.)\n   - Each test file focuses on a specific integration scenario\n   - Tests use a combination of mock hooks and Redux mock store for state management\n\n2. **Import Patterns**:\n   - Tests originally used `@/` path aliases, but have been updated to use direct relative imports\n   - The path pattern is typically `../../../../src/components/admin/[feature]/...`\n\n3. **Recent Changes**:\n   - According to checkpoint.md, all test files have been updated to use direct relative paths instead of alias patterns\n   - Hook directory structure has been created to match the expected paths in tests\n\n### Selected Test: FilterReset.test.tsx\n\nI've chosen to run the `FilterReset.test.tsx` as my first integration test to verify because:\n\n1. It's a good representative example of the integration tests\n2. It has multiple test cases for different aspects of filtering\n3. It integrates multiple components (ListingTable, ListingFilterBar, CategoryFilterTree, SiteFilterDropdown)\n4. It tests a user-facing feature that would be important to verify\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe FilterReset.test.tsx test should verify that:\n- Individual filters can be reset with their specific reset buttons\n- All filters can be reset with a \"Reset All\" button\n- The URL query parameters are updated when filters are reset\n- Reset buttons are only shown when filters are active\n\n### Plan for Execution\n\n1. Run the FilterReset.test.tsx file in isolation\n2. Observe any errors or issues that occur\n3. Fix any problems identified\n4. Verify the test runs successfully\n5. Document what was fixed and any recommendations\n\nI'll update the checkpoint with the results of running this test and any fixes made.\n\n### Test Execution Results\n\nI ran the `FilterReset.test.tsx` test and encountered an error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module 'react-redux' from 'tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx'\n```\n\nThis error indicates that the test is missing the required `react-redux` dependency. This is a package dependency issue rather than a code structure issue.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Missing Dependency**: The test is importing from `react-redux` (specifically the `Provider` component) but this package doesn't appear to be installed or accessible in the project.\n\n2. **Framework Configuration**: This suggests there might be an issue with the testing framework configuration or missing dependency installation.\n\n### Fix Plan\n\n1. **Install Missing Dependency**: Install react-redux if it's not already in the project\n   ```bash\n   npm install react-redux\n   ```\n\n2. **Check package.json**: Verify that redux-related packages are correctly listed in dependencies\n\n3. **Check Jest Configuration**: Ensure the Jest configuration correctly handles module resolution for packages like react-redux\n\n### Test Execution Results - Update\n\nAfter installing the `react-redux` package, I ran the test again and encountered another error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module 'redux-mock-store' from 'tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx'\n```\n\nI'm continuing to find and install missing dependencies. I've now installed:\n\n1. `react-redux` - The Redux bindings for React\n2. `redux-mock-store` - A mock store for testing Redux async actions and middleware\n\nThis reveals that the integration tests depend on multiple Redux-related packages that aren't explicitly listed in the main `package.json` dependencies.\n\n### Test Execution Results - Update 2\n\nAfter installing `redux-mock-store`, I ran the test again and encountered another error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module 'redux' from 'node_modules/redux-mock-store/dist/index-cjs.js'\n```\n\nI'm continuing to find and install missing dependencies. I've now installed:\n\n1. `react-redux` - The Redux bindings for React\n2. `redux-mock-store` - A mock store for testing Redux async actions and middleware\n3. `redux` - The core Redux library\n\nThis continues to highlight the dependency chain required for these integration tests.\n\n### Test Execution Results - Update 3\n\nAfter installing the required Redux packages, I ran the test again and encountered a different type of error:\n\n```\nFAIL tests/admin/integration/filtering/FilterReset.test.tsx\n  ● Test suite failed to run\n\n    Cannot find module '../../../../ui/button' from 'src/components/admin/listings/components/table/ListingFilterBar.tsx'\n```\n\nThis error indicates we have a different issue now, not related to missing dependencies but to component imports. The component is trying to import from a UI component library that's not available in the path it's looking for.\n\n### Analysis of UI Component Dependencies\n\nThe project appears to use a UI component library with an `@/ui` import path alias. This alias is likely defined in a webpack, Vite, or Next.js configuration but isn't correctly set up in the Jest testing environment.\n\nThere are a few potential solutions:\n\n1. **Mock the UI Components**:\n   - Create mock implementations of the UI components used in tests\n\n2. **Configure Jest Module Mapping**:\n   - Update the Jest configuration to map the `@/ui` path to the actual components\n\n3. **Create UI Component Stub Files**:\n   - Create minimal stub versions of UI components for testing\n\nGiven that we've already addressed the dependency issues by installing the missing packages, the next step is to address this component path issue.",

Create mock implementations for UI components used in tests\n2. Update Jest configuration to properly handle UI component imports\n3. Document the required testing dependencies\n4. Create a script for setting up the testing environment\n\nThis investigation has revealed important information about the project's testing infrastructure that will be valuable for fixing the remaining integration tests.",

      "body": "After attempting to run the component tests, I've determined that a more comprehensive solution is needed beyond simple file fixes. The project appears to have significant structural issues that prevent the tests from running correctly:\n\n1. **Missing Hook Files**: \n   The tests are trying to import hook files like `useAuth` from specific paths that don't exist. For example, the test is looking for `../../../../src/components/admin/auth/hooks/useAuth` which doesn't appear to be in the codebase.\n\n2. **Project Organization Mismatch**:\n   The test files expect a certain project organization (with hooks in separate directories) that doesn't match the actual implementation. The actual component structure may have changed significantly.\n\n3. **Incomplete Mock Infrastructure**:\n   The tests need a more robust mocking infrastructure that can handle the component dependencies properly.\n\n### Recommended Action Plan\n\n1. **Refactor Integration Tests**:\n   Instead of trying to fix individual test files, we should create a new, more maintainable test setup that matches the current project structure.\n\n2. **Create Hook Utility Modules**:\n   Implement proper hook utility modules that can be consistently used across both components and tests.\n\n3. **Consolidate Project Structure**:\n   Adopt a more consistent project structure that separates hooks, components, and utilities more clearly.\n\n4. **Implement Jest Module Mocking**:\n   Create a proper Jest setup that can mock modules without relying on specific file paths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe component tests require significant architectural changes to function correctly. Rather than attempting to fix each test individually, I recommend addressing the underlying architectural issues first. This would involve updating the project structure, creating proper hook utilities, and implementing a better mocking strategy.\n\nThis analysis has been recorded in the checkpoint.md file for future reference.",

The file now includes all necessary methods like setStatusFilter, setCategoryFilter, setFeaturedFilter, resetFilters, setSorting, setPage, setPerPage, and various selection and deletion operations.\n\n2. **Fixed Module Path Resolution**:\n   I've modified the AuthorizationBoundaries.test.tsx test to use direct relative imports instead of the '@/' alias. This avoids the path resolution issues with the Jest configuration. Each import now uses the full relative path like `../../../../src/components/...` instead of the alias.\n\n3. **Improved Test Mocking Approach**:\n   I've changed the mocking strategy to use explicit mock functions (mockUseAuth, mockUseListings, mockUseSites, mockUseRouter) instead of casting the imported hooks as jest.Mock. This provides better type safety and makes the mocking more explicit.\n\nThese changes should resolve the main issues preventing the tests from running.
