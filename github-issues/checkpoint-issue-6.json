  "title": "[ISSUE] Project Structure Analysis - [2025-03-31 15:30]",
  "body": "After analyzing the project structure and component tests, I've identified the key issues preventing the tests from running successfully and have begun implementing the solutions:\n\n1. **Missing Hook Directories**:\n   - ✅ Created auth hooks directory (`src/components/admin/auth/hooks`)\n   - ✅ Implemented `useAuth` hook with proper authentication logic\n   - ✅ Fixed sites hook structure to match expected imports\n\n2. **Inconsistent Structure Issues**:\n   - ✅ Added a consistent structure for the auth hooks\n   - ✅ Made the sites hooks follow the same pattern expected by tests\n   - ✅ Fixed the export pattern for useSites to work with both directory and file imports\n\n3. **Import Path Resolution**:\n   - The tests use direct path imports like `../../../../src/components/admin/auth/hooks/useAuth`\n   - Now that we've implemented the hooks in the expected locations, these imports should work\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Fixed Path Imports in Tests**:\n   - ✅ Updated cross-cutting test files to use direct relative imports\n   - ✅ Fixed path references in DataPersistence.test.tsx\n   - ✅ Fixed path references in ErrorRecovery.test.tsx\n\n2. **Verify Hook Functionality**:\n   - Need to test the new useAuth hook implementation\n   - Ensure useSites exports correctly match what tests expect\n\n3. **Continue Test Refactoring**:\n   - Update remaining integration tests with correct path imports\n   - Create a centralized mock setup for consistent hook mocking\n\n4. **Run Tests**:\n   - Try running the tests to see if our structure changes have fixed the issues\n   - Address any remaining errors one by one\n\nMy next focus will be on verifying the hook implementations work correctly with the tests.",
