  "title": "[ISSUE] Expanded Integration Testing Implementation - [2025-03-30 15:30]",
  "body": "I've completed implementing the expanded integration tests for the DirectoryMonster project. Based on the plan, I've created tests covering all the required areas:\n\n### 1. Filtering Systems Tests ✅\nI created tests for the filtering capabilities across tables:\n- CategoryFiltering.test.tsx: Tests category filtering on listings\n- CombinedFilters.test.tsx: Tests advanced filter combinations (category + site + status)\n- FilterPersistence.test.tsx: Tests filter persistence between navigation events\n- FilterReset.test.tsx: Tests filter reset functionality\n\n### 2. Site Creation and Management Tests ✅\nI implemented tests for site management features:\n- SiteCreationBasicInfo.test.tsx: Tests the initial step of site creation\n- SiteCreationDomains.test.tsx: Tests domain management within sites\n- SiteCreationSEO.test.tsx: Tests SEO settings configuration\n- SiteSubmission.test.tsx: Tests the complete submission process\n\n### 3. Listing-Category Relationship Tests ✅\nI created tests for the integration between listings and categories:\n- CategorySelectionInListing.test.tsx: Tests selecting categories during listing creation\n- CategoryFilteringNavigation.test.tsx: Tests category filtering and navigation\n\n### 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns Tests ✅\nI implemented tests for system-wide concerns:\n- AuthorizationBoundaries.test.tsx: Tests authorization between components\n- DataPersistence.test.tsx: Tests data persistence across page refreshes\n- NotificationSystems.test.tsx: Tests notification systems for operations\n- ErrorRecovery.test.tsx: Tests error recovery flows\n\n### Testing Approach\nAll tests follow our established pattern of small, focused test files with one test per file. Each test is organized in appropriate directories under tests/admin/integration/ to maintain our project structure.\n\nThe tests use mock stores, mock API calls, and mock hooks to simulate the different behaviors and states of the components. They verify that the components behave correctly in various scenarios and that the integration between components works as expected.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Consider adding more specific tests for edge cases in the integration points\n- Improve test coverage by addressing any gaps in the existing tests\n- Update documentation to reflect the new tests\n- Implement performance optimization as outlined in NEXTSTEPS.md",
