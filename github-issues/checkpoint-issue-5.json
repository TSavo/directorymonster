  "body": "I've successfully made progress on fixing the integration test issues by addressing the core structure problems:\n\n### Completed Work\n\n1. **Created Missing Hook Structure**\n   - ✅ Implemented `useAuth` hook with proper functionality\n   - ✅ Ensured proper exports for auth hooks\n   - ✅ Fixed sites hook exports to match test expectations\n\n2. **Fixed Test Import Paths**\n   - ✅ Updated DataPersistence.test.tsx with correct imports\n   - ✅ Updated ErrorRecovery.test.tsx with correct imports\n   - ✅ Replaced `@/` alias imports with direct relative paths\n\n3. **Made Structure Consistent**\n   - ✅ Created hook directories in expected locations\n   - ✅ Ensured component hooks follow the same structure pattern\n   - ✅ Fixed path references in tests\n\n### Remaining Work\n\n1. **Test Restructuring**\n   - Continue updating remaining integration tests with proper imports\n   - Apply the same pattern to the other test categories (filtering, etc.)\n   - Create a consistent mocking strategy for tests\n\n2. **Testing Infrastructure**\n   - Consider creating a shared test utilities directory\n   - Implement standardized mocking patterns\n   - Run tests and fix remaining issues one by one\n\n### Next Steps\n\nI'll continue updating the remaining test files to follow the same pattern I've established. The key approach is:\n\n1. Change `@/` imports to direct relative paths (`../../../../src/components/...`)\n2. Ensure all hooks are properly mocked with consistent patterns\n3. Run tests incrementally to catch and fix issues early\n\nGit commit has been created with the current changes, and I'll continue making improvements to the test structure.",
