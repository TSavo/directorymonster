  "body": "After reviewing the checkpoint.md, CLAUDE.md, and NEXTSTEPS.md files, I've compiled a summary of our current progress and next steps:\n\n### Completed Work\n\n1. **Core Component Implementation**\n   - ✅ Category Management functionality complete\n   - ✅ Listing Form components with multi-step navigation\n   - ✅ Listing Table components\n   - ✅ Site Management components\n   - ✅ Mobile-responsive UI components\n\n2. **Integration Testing**\n   - ✅ Fixed import paths in all 21 test files (replacing `@/` alias with direct relative paths)\n   - ✅ Created hook directories and implementations to match test expectations\n   - ✅ Implemented tests for all major feature areas (filtering, site-listing, site-management, cross-cutting)\n\n3. **Test Organization**\n   - ✅ Created a modular testing approach with one test per file\n   - ✅ Organized tests by feature area for better maintainability\n\n### Current Challenges\n\n1. **UI Component References**\n   - Tests reference UI components with paths like `../../../../ui/button` which don't match the current project structure\n   - Need to create mock implementations or update Jest configuration\n\n2. **Missing Dependencies**\n   - Identified and installed missing Redux-related dependencies\n   - May need additional dependencies for UI component testing\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Create Mock UI Components**\n   - Create mock implementations for UI components referenced in tests\n   - Update Jest configuration for proper component resolution\n\n2. **Implement UI Component Mocks**\n   - Develop the necessary UI component mocks to make tests pass\n   - Focus on creating minimal implementations that satisfy test requirements\n\n3. **Testing Infrastructure**\n   - Create a central mock repository for consistent testing\n   - Update testing documentation with dependency requirements\n\n4. **Documentation Updates**\n   - Update admin MVP documentation\n   - Create comprehensive test setup guide",
