# Security Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive set of security considerations for developers working on our application. Use this checklist when developing new features or reviewing code.

## Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Use the provided JWT authentication system for all protected routes
- [ ] Implement proper authorization checks using the role-based access control system
- [ ] Validate user permissions before allowing access to resources
- [ ] Ensure tenant isolation for multi-tenant resources
- [ ] Use refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- [ ] Implement proper logout functionality that revokes tokens
- [ ] Use secure password storage with bcrypt or Argon2
- [ ] Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- [ ] Require strong passwords (minimum length, complexity)
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

## JWT Security

- [ ] Use short-lived access tokens (1 hour or less)
- [ ] Implement token revocation
- [ ] Validate all required claims (userId, jti, exp, iat)
- [ ] Check for token tampering
- [ ] Use asymmetric keys (RS256) in production
- [ ] Rotate keys periodically
- [ ] Store keys securely (environment variables, key management service)
- [ ] Never store sensitive data in JWT payload

## Input Validation

- [ ] Validate all user input on the server side
- [ ] Use parameterized queries for database operations
- [ ] Sanitize output to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
- [ ] Use content security policy to restrict script execution

## API Security

- [ ] Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Validate Content-Type headers
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Use security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Validate request origin for sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement API versioning

## Data Protection

- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Use HTTPS for data in transit
- [ ] Implement proper database access controls
- [ ] Use prepared statements for database queries
- [ ] Implement data minimization (only collect what's needed)
- [ ] Implement proper data retention policies
- [ ] Secure backup and recovery procedures

## Session Management

- [ ] Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- [ ] Implement proper session timeout
- [ ] Regenerate session IDs after login
- [ ] Validate session data on each request
- [ ] Implement proper session termination on logout

## Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] Implement centralized error handling
- [ ] Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] Log security events for audit purposes
- [ ] Implement proper log rotation and retention
- [ ] Sanitize logs to remove sensitive information
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity

## Frontend Security

- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Use subresource integrity for external resources
- [ ] Sanitize user input before rendering
- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
- [ ] Use secure localStorage/sessionStorage practices
- [ ] Implement proper client-side validation (in addition to server-side)

## Infrastructure Security

- [ ] Keep dependencies up to date
- [ ] Scan for vulnerabilities regularly
- [ ] Use secure deployment practices
- [ ] Implement proper network segmentation
- [ ] Use secure configuration for production environments
- [ ] Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Use secure communication between services

## Testing

- [ ] Implement security unit tests
- [ ] Perform regular security code reviews
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Use automated security scanning tools
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Implement proper test coverage for security-critical code

## Compliance

- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement proper privacy controls
- [ ] Document data processing activities
- [ ] Implement proper consent management
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
- [ ] Document security measures

## Incident Response

- [ ] Have an incident response plan
- [ ] Document security incidents
- [ ] Implement proper notification procedures
- [ ] Conduct post-incident reviews
- [ ] Update security measures based on incidents
