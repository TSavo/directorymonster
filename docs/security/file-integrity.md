# File Integrity Checks

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of integrity checks for cryptographic files to prevent tampering.

## Previous Implementation

The previous implementation did not include any integrity checks for cryptographic files, which could allow an attacker to modify these files without detection.

## Improved Implementation

The improved implementation adds a file integrity module that generates and verifies SHA-256 checksums for all cryptographic files.

```typescript
// src/lib/file-integrity.ts
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as crypto from 'crypto';

/**
 * Generate a SHA-256 checksum for a file
 * @param filePath - The path to the file
 * @returns The SHA-256 checksum as a hex string
 */
export function generateChecksum(filePath: string): string {
  // Check if the file exists
  if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
    throw new Error(`File not found: ${filePath}`);
  }
  
  // Read the file
  const fileBuffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
  
  // Create a SHA-256 hash
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256');
  
  // Update the hash with the file content
  hash.update(fileBuffer);
  
  // Return the hash as a hex string
  return hash.digest('hex');
}

/**
 * Verify the integrity of a file by comparing its checksum to an expected value
 * @param filePath - The path to the file
 * @param expectedChecksum - The expected SHA-256 checksum
 * @returns True if the file integrity is verified, false otherwise
 */
export function verifyFileIntegrity(filePath: string, expectedChecksum: string): boolean {
  try {
    // Generate the checksum for the file
    const actualChecksum = generateChecksum(filePath);
    
    // Compare the checksums
    return actualChecksum === expectedChecksum;
  } catch (error) {
    // Re-throw the error
    throw error;
  }
}

// ... additional functions for verifying all files, generating checksums, etc.
```

Additionally, scripts were added to generate and verify checksums:

- `scripts/generate-checksums.ts` - Generates checksums for all cryptographic files
- `scripts/verify-checksums.ts` - Verifies the integrity of all cryptographic files

## Security Benefits

1. **Tamper Detection**: Allows detection of any modifications to cryptographic files.
2. **Integrity Verification**: Ensures that the files used in the ZKP system haven't been modified.
3. **Supply Chain Security**: Protects against supply chain attacks that might modify cryptographic files.
4. **Automated Verification**: Provides automated tools for verifying file integrity.

## Testing

The implementation is tested in:

- `tests/crypto/file-integrity.test.ts`

Run the tests with:

```bash
npx jest tests/crypto/file-integrity.test.ts
```

## CI/CD Integration

This security improvement is verified in the CI/CD pipeline through:

- The `security-checks.yml` workflow
- The `zkp-auth.yml` workflow with added security checks

## Best Practices

1. Generate checksums for all cryptographic files and store them in a secure location.
2. Verify file integrity before using cryptographic files.
3. Use a strong cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or stronger) for checksums.
4. Automate the verification process to ensure it's always performed.
5. Update checksums whenever cryptographic files are legitimately modified.
