## Overview

The authentication system implements multiple layers of security to protect against various types of attacks, including brute force attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and resource exhaustion attacks. The system uses a combination of worker pools, concurrency management, rate limiting, progressive delay, IP blocking, and CAPTCHA integration to provide comprehensive security.

## Security Components

### Worker Pool

The worker pool is a key component of the authentication system that provides the following security benefits:

- **Isolation**: Each authentication request is processed in a separate worker thread, isolating it from other requests and preventing a single malicious request from affecting the entire system.
- **Resource Management**: The worker pool limits the number of concurrent authentication requests, preventing resource exhaustion attacks.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If a worker thread crashes, the worker pool automatically creates a new worker to replace it, ensuring that the system remains available.

#### Implementation

The worker pool is implemented in `src/lib/auth/worker-pool.ts` and uses the Node.js `worker_threads` module to create and manage worker threads. The worker pool provides the following features:

- **Dynamic Sizing**: The worker pool automatically adjusts its size based on the number of CPU cores available, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Task Queue**: If all workers are busy, new tasks are queued until a worker becomes available.
- **Error Handling**: If a worker encounters an error, the worker pool automatically creates a new worker to replace it.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The worker pool provides a method to gracefully shut down all workers when the application is terminated.

### Concurrency Management

Concurrency management is a critical component of the authentication system that prevents resource exhaustion attacks by limiting the number of concurrent authentication requests. It provides the following security benefits:

- **Global Concurrency Limits**: The system limits the total number of concurrent authentication requests across all users.
- **Per-User Concurrency Limits**: The system limits the number of concurrent authentication requests for each user.
- **Distributed Locking**: The system uses Redis to implement distributed locks, ensuring that concurrency limits are enforced across multiple instances of the application.

#### Implementation

Concurrency management is implemented in `src/lib/auth/concurrency.ts` and uses Redis to track and limit concurrent requests. The concurrency management system provides the following features:

- **Atomic Operations**: All concurrency operations are atomic, ensuring that concurrency limits are enforced correctly.
- **Distributed State**: The system uses Redis to store concurrency state, ensuring that concurrency limits are enforced across multiple instances of the application.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: The system automatically cleans up concurrency state after a request is completed, ensuring that resources are not leaked.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a fundamental security measure that prevents brute force attacks by limiting the number of authentication attempts within a specific time window. It provides the following security benefits:

- **Request Rate Limiting**: The system limits the number of authentication requests per IP address within a specific time window.
- **Configurable Limits**: The rate limits are configurable based on the risk level of the IP address.
- **Distributed State**: The system uses Redis to store rate limiting state, ensuring that rate limits are enforced across multiple instances of the application.

#### Implementation

Rate limiting is implemented in `src/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts` using the `next-rate-limit` middleware. The rate limiting system provides the following features:

- **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: The system limits the number of authentication requests per IP address.
- **Configurable Time Windows**: The time window for rate limiting is configurable.
- **Custom Response**: The system provides a custom response when rate limits are exceeded, including information about when the rate limit will reset.

### Progressive Delay

Progressive delay is an advanced security measure that adds increasing delays to authentication attempts after failed attempts. It provides the following security benefits:

- **Exponential Backoff**: The delay increases exponentially with each failed attempt, making brute force attacks increasingly time-consuming.
- **Jitter**: Random jitter is added to the delay to prevent attackers from predicting the exact delay.
- **IP-Based Tracking**: The system tracks failed attempts per IP address, ensuring that delays are applied consistently.

#### Implementation

Progressive delay is implemented in `src/lib/auth/progressive-delay.ts` and uses Redis to track failed attempts and calculate delays. The progressive delay system provides the following features:

- **Exponential Backoff**: The delay increases exponentially with each failed attempt, starting from 1 second and doubling with each attempt.
- **Maximum Delay**: The delay is capped at a maximum value to prevent excessive delays for legitimate users.
- **Jitter**: Random jitter of Â±10% is added to the delay to prevent attackers from predicting the exact delay.
- **Automatic Reset**: The delay is automatically reset after a successful authentication.

### IP Blocking

IP blocking is a powerful security measure that blocks IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior. It provides the following security benefits:

- **Temporary Blocking**: IP addresses are temporarily blocked after exceeding a configurable number of failed authentication attempts.
- **Risk-Based Thresholds**: The threshold for blocking is based on the risk level of the IP address.
- **Configurable Block Duration**: The duration of the block is configurable based on the risk level of the IP address.

#### Implementation

IP blocking is implemented in `src/lib/auth/ip-blocker.ts` and uses Redis to track failed attempts and block IP addresses. The IP blocking system provides the following features:

- **Risk-Based Thresholds**: The threshold for blocking is based on the risk level of the IP address, with lower thresholds for high-risk IP addresses.
- **Configurable Block Duration**: The duration of the block is configurable based on the risk level of the IP address, with longer durations for high-risk IP addresses.
- **Automatic Unblocking**: IP addresses are automatically unblocked after the block duration expires.
- **Audit Logging**: All blocking events are logged for audit purposes.

### CAPTCHA Integration

CAPTCHA integration is a user-friendly security measure that prevents automated attacks by requiring human verification. It provides the following security benefits:

- **Human Verification**: CAPTCHA requires human interaction, preventing automated attacks.
- **Progressive Application**: CAPTCHA is only required after a configurable number of failed authentication attempts.
- **Risk-Based Thresholds**: The threshold for requiring CAPTCHA is based on the risk level of the IP address.

#### Implementation

CAPTCHA integration is implemented in `src/lib/auth/captcha-service.ts` for the server-side and `src/components/admin/auth/CaptchaWidget.tsx` for the client-side. The CAPTCHA integration provides the following features:

- **reCAPTCHA Support**: The system supports Google reCAPTCHA for CAPTCHA verification.
- **Custom CAPTCHA Fallback**: If reCAPTCHA is not available, the system falls back to a custom CAPTCHA implementation.
- **Risk-Based Thresholds**: The threshold for requiring CAPTCHA is based on the risk level of the IP address, with lower thresholds for high-risk IP addresses.
- **Automatic Reset**: The CAPTCHA requirement is automatically reset after a successful authentication.

## Security Measures

### Brute Force Protection

The authentication system implements multiple layers of protection against brute force attacks:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of authentication attempts per IP address within a specific time window.
2. **Progressive Delay**: Adds increasing delays to authentication attempts after failed attempts.
3. **IP Blocking**: Blocks IP addresses that exceed a configurable number of failed authentication attempts.
4. **CAPTCHA Integration**: Requires human verification after a configurable number of failed authentication attempts.

These measures work together to make brute force attacks impractical by significantly increasing the time and resources required to perform such attacks.

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection

The authentication system implements multiple layers of protection against DDoS attacks:

1. **Worker Pool**: Limits the number of concurrent authentication requests, preventing resource exhaustion.
2. **Concurrency Management**: Limits the number of concurrent authentication requests per user and globally.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of authentication attempts per IP address within a specific time window.
4. **IP Blocking**: Blocks IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior.

These measures work together to protect the system from DDoS attacks by limiting the resources that can be consumed by a single IP address or user.

### Resource Exhaustion Protection

The authentication system implements multiple layers of protection against resource exhaustion attacks:

1. **Worker Pool**: Limits the number of concurrent authentication requests, preventing resource exhaustion.
2. **Concurrency Management**: Limits the number of concurrent authentication requests per user and globally.
3. **Task Queue**: Queues authentication requests when all workers are busy, preventing resource exhaustion.
4. **Timeouts**: Implements timeouts for authentication requests, preventing long-running requests from consuming resources.

These measures work together to protect the system from resource exhaustion attacks by limiting the resources that can be consumed by authentication requests.
