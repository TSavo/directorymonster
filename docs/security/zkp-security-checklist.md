# ZKP Authentication Security Checklist

This checklist provides a comprehensive set of security checks for the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication system. Use this checklist during development, code review, and deployment to ensure all security measures are properly implemented.

## Password Hashing

- [ ] Use bcrypt for password hashing with a salt rounds value of at least 12
- [ ] Never store passwords in plain text or use fast hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-256)
- [ ] Verify password hashes using bcrypt.compare, not by generating a new hash
- [ ] Keep the bcrypt library updated to benefit from security improvements

## ZKP Circuit Privacy

- [ ] Mark all private inputs with the `private` keyword in circom circuits
- [ ] Verify the privacy settings in the `.sym` file after compilation
- [ ] Test that private inputs are not exposed in the public signals
- [ ] Follow the principle of least privilege for public signals

## TypeScript Type Definitions

- [ ] Avoid using reserved keywords as identifiers in TypeScript code
- [ ] Use descriptive names for functions and variables
- [ ] Follow TypeScript naming conventions (camelCase for functions, PascalCase for types)
- [ ] Keep type definitions in sync with the actual implementation

## HTTP Headers

- [ ] Set headers on the response object, not the request object
- [ ] Include standard rate limit headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
- [ ] Add Retry-After header for 429 responses
- [ ] Use consistent time formats (Unix timestamp) for reset times

## Division by Zero Protection

- [ ] Check for division by zero before performing division operations in circuits
- [ ] Use both constraint-based checks (`!= 0`) and signal-based checks
- [ ] Add detailed comments explaining the purpose of each check
- [ ] Implement a pattern that can detect division by zero at compile time

## File Integrity

- [ ] Generate checksums for all cryptographic files
- [ ] Verify file integrity before using cryptographic files
- [ ] Use SHA-256 or stronger for checksums
- [ ] Automate the verification process
- [ ] Update checksums when cryptographic files are legitimately modified

## Poseidon Hash Constants

- [ ] Use cryptographically secure constants from a well-documented source
- [ ] Ensure the MDS matrix has a non-zero determinant
- [ ] Document the source and generation method of cryptographic constants
- [ ] Use a sufficient number of constants (at least 20)
- [ ] Test the entropy and cryptographic properties of the constants

## Hash Truncation

- [ ] Never truncate cryptographic hash values unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] If truncation is required, use at least 128 bits
- [ ] Document any truncation and its security implications
- [ ] Use the full hash value whenever possible
- [ ] Consider the collision probability when determining hash output size

## Poseidon Round Parameters

- [ ] Use at least 8 full rounds for the Poseidon hash function
- [ ] Use at least 57 partial rounds for the Poseidon hash function
- [ ] Use all available constants to maximize entropy
- [ ] Balance security with performance considerations
- [ ] Stay updated with the latest cryptanalysis

## General Security Measures

- [ ] Run all security tests before deployment
- [ ] Verify cryptographic file integrity in the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Perform security audits regularly
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document all security measures and their rationale
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for cryptographic operations
- [ ] Use secure random number generation for cryptographic operations
- [ ] Protect against timing attacks in cryptographic operations
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for sensitive operations
- [ ] Log security-relevant events for auditing purposes

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm run security:test` to verify all security improvements
- [ ] Run `npm run security:verify` to check cryptographic file integrity
- [ ] Run `npm audit --production` to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Verify that all security checks pass in the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Document any security exceptions and their mitigations
- [ ] Perform a final security review before deployment
- [ ] Monitor security-relevant logs after deployment
- [ ] Have a plan for responding to security incidents
