## Overview

Our application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).

## Token Types

We use two types of tokens:

1. **Access Tokens**: Short-lived tokens (1 hour) used to access protected resources.
2. **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived tokens (7 days) used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.

## Security Features

Our JWT implementation includes the following security features:

- **Token Expiration**: All tokens have an expiration time.
- **Token Revocation**: Tokens can be revoked before they expire.
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated on each use.
- **Token Family Tracking**: Refresh tokens are tracked in families to detect token theft.
- **Rate Limiting**: Authentication endpoints are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Asymmetric Key Support**: Support for RS256 and other asymmetric algorithms.
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events.
- **Security Headers**: HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Token Validation

All tokens are validated using the following checks:

1. **Signature Verification**: Ensures the token has not been tampered with.
2. **Expiration Check**: Ensures the token has not expired.
3. **Required Claims**: Ensures the token has all required claims (userId, jti, exp, iat).
4. **Algorithm Validation**: Ensures the token was signed with the expected algorithm.
5. **Token Age Check**: Ensures the token is not too old (potential replay attack).
6. **Token Lifetime Check**: Ensures the token does not have a suspiciously long lifetime.
7. **Revocation Check**: Ensures the token has not been revoked.

## Token Revocation

Tokens can be revoked in the following ways:

1. **Individual Token Revocation**: Revoke a specific token by its JTI (JWT ID).
2. **Token Family Revocation**: Revoke all tokens in a family (useful for detecting token theft).
3. **User Token Revocation**: Revoke all tokens for a specific user (useful for password changes or account lockouts).

## Refresh Token Rotation

Refresh tokens are rotated on each use to enhance security:

1. When a refresh token is used, it is immediately revoked.
2. A new refresh token is issued with the same family ID.
3. If a previously used refresh token is presented, all tokens in that family are revoked (token theft detection).

## Rate Limiting

Authentication endpoints are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks:

1. **Login**: 5 attempts per minute per IP address.
2. **Refresh Token**: 10 attempts per minute per IP address.
3. **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour per IP address.

## Security Headers

The application includes the following security headers:

1. **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts the sources from which resources can be loaded.
2. **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing.
3. **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks.
4. **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser's built-in XSS filtering.
5. **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is included with requests.
6. **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces browsers to use HTTPS.
7. **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts which browser features can be used.

## Security Logging

Security events are logged for audit and monitoring purposes:

1. **Authentication Events**: Login success, login failure, logout.
2. **Token Events**: Token validation success/failure, token revocation.
3. **Access Control Events**: Unauthorized access, permission denied.
4. **Rate Limiting Events**: Rate limit exceeded.
5. **User Events**: Password change, password reset, user creation/update/deletion.

## Best Practices

When working with JWTs, follow these best practices:

1. **Never store sensitive data in JWTs**: JWTs are not encrypted by default.
2. **Use short expiration times for access tokens**: 15-60 minutes is recommended.
3. **Implement token revocation**: Always have a way to revoke tokens.
4. **Use refresh token rotation**: Rotate refresh tokens on each use.
5. **Validate all tokens thoroughly**: Implement all validation checks.
6. **Use asymmetric keys in production**: RS256 is preferred over HS256.
7. **Implement rate limiting**: Protect authentication endpoints.
8. **Log security events**: Monitor for suspicious activity.
9. **Use secure storage for tokens**: Store tokens in HttpOnly, Secure cookies or secure local storage.
10. **Implement proper error handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in error messages.

## Testing

Our JWT implementation includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Token Validation Tests**: Tests for all validation checks.
2. **Token Tampering Tests**: Tests for detecting tampered tokens.
3. **Token Expiration Tests**: Tests for handling expired tokens.
4. **Token Revocation Tests**: Tests for revoking tokens.
5. **Refresh Token Rotation Tests**: Tests for rotating refresh tokens.
6. **Rate Limiting Tests**: Tests for rate limiting functionality.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test -- tests/security/jwt
```

## Conclusion

This JWT security implementation follows industry best practices and provides a robust security foundation for our application. By following the guidelines in this document, developers can ensure that authentication and authorization are handled securely.
