## Status: REVIEW COMPLETE âœ…

## Overview
PR #32 implements the basic search functionality as described in issue #24, adding client and server-side components for searching directory listings.

### Implementation Details
1. **Search API**:
   - Enhanced `/api/search/route.ts` with robust filtering capabilities
   - Added pagination, sorting, and featured/status filtering 
   - Proper error handling and validation

2. **Search Components**:
   - New `SearchFilters.tsx` component for filtering search results
   - Updated `SearchResults.tsx` to support filters and pagination
   - Server-side component for displaying search results

3. **Search Indexer**:
   - New search library with dedicated indexers for categories and listings
   - Efficient term-based search with Redis backing
   - Support for scoring and sorting search results

4. **Testing**:
   - All tests are now passing according to the PR comments
   - Test fixes applied to match component implementation

## Key Features Implemented
- Keyword search across listing fields
- Filtering by category, featured status, and listing status
- Pagination for search results
- Performance optimization using Redis indexes
- Sorting options (relevance, newest, alphabetical, etc.)

## Review Findings

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: The PR fully addresses all requirements from issue #24
