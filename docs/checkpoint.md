# Checkpoint: API E2E Testing Specifications and Implementation Plan - April 2, 2025

## Current Progress

We have made significant progress in developing comprehensive API testing specifications for the DirectoryMonster project. So far, we have created the following:

### Completed API Testing Specifications

1. **Sites API**:
   - GET /api/sites - Retrieving all sites
   - POST /api/sites - Creating a new site
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug] - Retrieving a specific site

2. **Categories API**:
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories - Retrieving all categories
   - POST /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories - Creating a new category
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Retrieving a specific category
   - PUT /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Updating a category
   - DELETE /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Deleting a category

3. **Listings API**:
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings - Retrieving all listings
   - POST /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings - Creating a new listing
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Retrieving a specific listing
   - PUT /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Updating a listing

4. **Auth API**:
   - POST /api/auth/setup - Initial system setup
   - POST /api/auth/refresh - Refreshing authentication tokens

5. **Search API**:
   - GET /api/search - Searching for listings with filtering and pagination

### E2E Testing Framework Setup

We've also set up the foundational components for E2E API testing:

1. Created `api-test-base.js` with common testing utilities
2. Implemented `auth-helper.js` for authentication in tests
3. Set up Jest configuration for API E2E tests
4. Added npm scripts for running API tests

## Remaining Work

### API Specifications to Complete

1. **Listings API**:
   - DELETE /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Deleting a listing

2. **Admin API**:
   - Various admin panel API endpoints

3. **Auth API**:
   - POST /api/auth/login - User authentication/login
   - Other auth-related endpoints (password reset, verification, etc.)

4. **User Management API**:
   - User CRUD operations
   - Role and permission management

5. **Tenant API**:
   - Tenant management endpoints

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Test Implementation**:
   - Create actual test files based on specifications
   - Implement test cases using SuperTest and Jest
   - Create test fixtures and mocks

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add API tests to CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure test reporting

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create a comprehensive guide for running and maintaining API tests
   - Document test coverage and results interpretation

## Next Steps

1. Complete specifications for remaining API endpoints
2. Implement actual test files for highest-priority endpoints:
   - Start with auth endpoints (crucial for all other tests)
   - Then implement site and category tests
   - Finally implement listing and search tests
3. Create test utility functions for common operations
4. Set up continuous integration for API tests

## Lessons Learned

1. The multi-tenant nature of DirectoryMonster requires special attention to isolation testing
2. Many endpoints need to be tested with both authenticated and unauthenticated access
3. Redis transactions require careful testing for atomicity
4. Search indexing errors should not fail API operations but should be logged
5. URL generation logic needs comprehensive testing for various domain configurations

## Conclusion

The API testing specification work is approximately 70% complete. The remaining specifications should follow the same pattern established in the existing ones. Once specifications are complete, implementation of actual tests can begin, focusing first on auth endpoints which are prerequisites for testing most other endpoints.

## Implementation Plan for Next Phase

For the next phase of this project, we will begin implementation of API tests following these steps:

1. **Set up standardized test utilities**:
   - Enhance `api-test-base.js` with more robust error handling
   - Create Redis mock factories for different testing scenarios
   - Build fixture generators for sites, categories, and listings
   - Implement authentication testing helpers with various permission sets

2. **Implement core auth tests first**:
   - Set up tests for /api/auth/setup (first user creation)
   - Implement token acquisition and validation tests
   - Create test suite for token refresh and expiration

3. **Create site and category foundation tests**:
   - Implement site creation and retrieval test suites
   - Build category hierarchy test suites
   - Set up cross-referencing validation tests

4. **Implement listing and search tests**:
   - Create listing CRUD test suite with Redis validation
   - Implement search indexing validation tests
   - Build pagination and filtering test cases

5. **Add multi-tenant security tests**:
   - Implement cross-tenant isolation test cases
   - Create permission-based access control tests
   - Add tenant context validation tests

This phased approach ensures we build from the foundational APIs up to the more complex listing and search functionality, with a focus on security and data integrity throughout.
