# Checkpoint: Fixing Jest Configuration Issues - April 9, 2025

## Changes Made to Fix Jest Project Configuration

I've identified and fixed the configuration issues with the Jest tests. The main problems were:

1. **Missing displayName Property**: 
   - The Jest projects configuration was missing displayName properties
   - This caused the --selectProjects option to fail
   - Added displayName to each project configuration

2. **Projects Configuration Structure**:
   - Created a new dedicated file `jest.projects.config.js` for project-based testing
   - Added proper project definitions with clear displayNames
   - Updated the package.json scripts to use the new config file

3. **waitForNextUpdate Functionality**:
   - Fixed the missing waitForNextUpdate functionality in react-hooks mock
   - Enhanced the implementation to properly track state updates
   - Made the functionality more robust

4. **Project Selection Commands**:
   - Updated npm scripts in package.json:
     - `test:unit` now uses `--config jest.projects.config.js --selectProjects=UNIT`
     - `test:component` now uses `--config jest.projects.config.js --selectProjects=COMPONENT`
     - `test:integration` now uses `--config jest.projects.config.js --selectProjects=INTEGRATION`
     - `test:hook` now uses `--config jest.projects.config.js --selectProjects=HOOK`
     - `test:api` now uses `--config jest.projects.config.js --selectProjects=API`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the New Configuration**:
   - Run the individual project tests to verify they work
   - Check for any remaining issues with waitForNextUpdate
   - Run the fixed tests to ensure they still pass

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the new project structure
   - Create guidelines for adding new test projects

3. **Fix Remaining Test Issues**:
   - Address state management issues in failing tests
   - Fix components with missing imports or dependencies

## Previous Work (April 9, 2025 - Earlier Today)

I ran the directorymonster tests with different test commands. Here's a summary of the results:

1. **Fixed Tests** (`npm run test:fixed`):
   - All 18 test suites passed
   - 148 tests total (3 skipped, 145 passed)
   - These tests appear to be a subset of stable tests that consistently pass

2. **Component Tests** (`npx jest --testMatch="**/src/components/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"`):
   - Mixed results with several failing tests
   - Many hook-related tests failed due to state management issues
   - Common failures included:
     - Expected vs. actual state in hooks
     - Missing waitForNextUpdate functionality
     - Component test failures due to missing dependencies
   - Several authentication and security-related tests passed successfully

3. **API and Unit Test Selection Projects**:
   - The commands `npm run test:api` and `npm run test:unit` failed because the project selection configuration was not properly set up
   - Error: "You provided values for --selectProjects but a project does not have a name."

## Analysis of Test Failures

The test failures observed seem to fall into several categories:

1. **State Management Issues**:
   - Many hook tests expect state changes that aren't happening
   - Expected state values don't match actual values
   - Missing or incorrect initialization of state

2. **Configuration Problems**:
   - The Jest project configuration was incomplete
   - Project names weren't specified for selectProjects to work
   - Some test paths may not be correctly mapped

3. **Missing Functionality**:
   - waitForNextUpdate was not properly defined or mocked
   - Some components or hooks appear to be broken or incompletely implemented

## Previous Progress (April 2, 2025)

We have made significant progress in developing comprehensive API testing specifications for the DirectoryMonster project. So far, we have created the following:

### Completed API Testing Specifications

1. **Sites API**:
   - GET /api/sites - Retrieving all sites
   - POST /api/sites - Creating a new site
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug] - Retrieving a specific site

2. **Categories API**:
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories - Retrieving all categories
   - POST /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories - Creating a new category
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Retrieving a specific category
   - PUT /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Updating a category
   - DELETE /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Deleting a category

3. **Listings API**:
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings - Retrieving all listings
   - POST /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings - Creating a new listing
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Retrieving a specific listing
   - PUT /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Updating a listing

4. **Auth API**:
   - POST /api/auth/setup - Initial system setup
   - POST /api/auth/refresh - Refreshing authentication tokens

5. **Search API**:
   - GET /api/search - Searching for listings with filtering and pagination

### E2E Testing Framework Setup

We've also set up the foundational components for E2E API testing:

1. Created `api-test-base.js` with common testing utilities
2. Implemented `auth-helper.js` for authentication in tests
3. Set up Jest configuration for API E2E tests
4. Added npm scripts for running API tests

## Remaining Work

### API Specifications to Complete

1. **Listings API**:
   - DELETE /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Deleting a listing

2. **Admin API**:
   - Various admin panel API endpoints

3. **Auth API**:
   - POST /api/auth/login - User authentication/login
   - Other auth-related endpoints (password reset, verification, etc.)

4. **User Management API**:
   - User CRUD operations
   - Role and permission management

5. **Tenant API**:
   - Tenant management endpoints

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Test Implementation**:
   - Create actual test files based on specifications
   - Implement test cases using SuperTest and Jest
   - Create test fixtures and mocks

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add API tests to CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure test reporting

3. **Documentation**:
   - Create a comprehensive guide for running and maintaining API tests
   - Document test coverage and results interpretation

### Lessons Learned & Conclusions

After analyzing the current test status, it's clear that:

1. The DirectoryMonster project has a mix of stable and unstable tests
2. The most reliable tests are in the 'fixed' subset
3. Hook-related tests need more work to stabilize
4. Jest configuration needs updating to support project selection
5. The test documentation should be updated to reflect the current state
