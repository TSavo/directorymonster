# Checkpoint: Fixing Jest Configuration Issues - April 9, 2025

## Progress Update

I've made significant improvements to the Jest configuration and test setup. While we've fixed the initial configuration issues that prevented running project-specific tests, there are still several failing tests that need attention.

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Jest Projects Configuration**:
   - Created a dedicated `jest.projects.config.js` file with proper project definitions
   - Added `displayName` property to each project configuration
   - Updated package.json scripts to use the new config file

2. **CommonJS/ESM Compatibility**:
   - Fixed the `next/link.js` mock to use proper CommonJS syntax
   - Updated `tests/utils/render.js` to use CommonJS exports instead of ESM

3. **Mock Implementation**:
   - Fixed issues with React references in mock factory functions
   - Implemented proper error handling in module mocks

### Successful Tests:

We've confirmed that the Button component tests are passing successfully using our new configuration. This is a good indicator that our approach works for properly structured tests.

### Remaining Issues:

1. **Module Path Mapping**:
   - Many tests fail with the error: `Could not locate module @/tests/utils/render mapped as: C:\Users\T\directorymonster\src\$1`
   - The path mapping for `@/tests/...` is not working correctly

2. **Hook State Management Issues**:
   - Several hook tests fail due to state not updating as expected
   - Tests expect state changes that aren't occurring
   - Need to improve our waitForNextUpdate implementation

3. **Component Import Errors**:
   - Some tests fail due to missing or improperly exported components
   - Particularly in the admin components section

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Module Path Mapping**:
   - Update the moduleNameMapper configuration to properly map `@/tests/...` to the correct path
   - Consider adding an additional mapping specifically for test utilities

2. **Improve Hook Tests**:
   - Update the waitForNextUpdate implementation to better handle state changes
   - Review failing hook tests and fix state management issues

3. **Fix Component Imports**:
   - Identify and fix missing component exports
   - Ensure proper imports in test files

4. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Once the basic configuration is working properly, expand test coverage
   - Focus on critical components and functionality first

## Tests Summary

We ran several test suites with our updated configuration:

1. **Button Component Tests**: All 15 tests are passing
2. **Unit Tests**: 15 passing, 23 failing out of 38 tests
   - Many failures due to module path mapping issues
   - Some failures due to state management in hooks
3. **API Tests**: Currently not functioning due to missing test files

## Previous Work (April 9, 2025 - Earlier Today)

I ran the directorymonster tests with different test commands. Here's a summary of the results:

1. **Fixed Tests** (`npm run test:fixed`):
   - All 18 test suites passed
   - 148 tests total (3 skipped, 145 passed)
   - These tests appear to be a subset of stable tests that consistently pass

2. **Component Tests** (`npx jest --testMatch="**/src/components/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"`):
   - Mixed results with several failing tests
   - Many hook-related tests failed due to state management issues
   - Common failures included:
     - Expected vs. actual state in hooks
     - Missing waitForNextUpdate functionality
     - Component test failures due to missing dependencies
   - Several authentication and security-related tests passed successfully

3. **API and Unit Test Selection Projects**:
   - The commands `npm run test:api` and `npm run test:unit` failed because the project selection configuration was not properly set up
   - Error: "You provided values for --selectProjects but a project does not have a name."

## Analysis of Test Failures

The test failures observed seem to fall into several categories:

1. **State Management Issues**:
   - Many hook tests expect state changes that aren't happening
   - Expected state values don't match actual values
   - Missing or incorrect initialization of state

2. **Configuration Problems**:
   - The Jest project configuration was incomplete
   - Project names weren't specified for selectProjects to work
   - Some test paths may not be correctly mapped

3. **Missing Functionality**:
   - waitForNextUpdate was not properly defined or mocked
   - Some components or hooks appear to be broken or incompletely implemented

## Previous Progress (April 2, 2025)

We have made significant progress in developing comprehensive API testing specifications for the DirectoryMonster project. So far, we have created the following:

### Completed API Testing Specifications

1. **Sites API**:
   - GET /api/sites - Retrieving all sites
   - POST /api/sites - Creating a new site
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug] - Retrieving a specific site

2. **Categories API**:
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories - Retrieving all categories
   - POST /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories - Creating a new category
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Retrieving a specific category
   - PUT /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Updating a category
   - DELETE /api/sites/[siteSlug]/categories/[categoryId] - Deleting a category

3. **Listings API**:
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings - Retrieving all listings
   - POST /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings - Creating a new listing
   - GET /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Retrieving a specific listing
   - PUT /api/sites/[siteSlug]/listings/[listingId] - Updating a listing

4. **Auth API**:
   - POST /api/auth/setup - Initial system setup
   - POST /api/auth/refresh - Refreshing authentication tokens

5. **Search API**:
   - GET /api/search - Searching for listings with filtering and pagination
