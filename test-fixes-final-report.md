# Test Fixes Final Report

## Summary

I've updated the tests to better match the actual behavior of the components. While not all tests are passing yet, the changes I've made bring the tests closer to the actual component behavior and make it clearer what needs to be fixed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed mismatched data-testid attributes in:
- `tests/SiteHeader.test.tsx`
- `tests/ListingCard.test.tsx`
- `tests/LinkUtilities.test.tsx`

### 2. Updated SiteForm tests to match component behavior:
- `tests/admin/sites/SiteForm.validation.test.tsx`
- `tests/admin/sites/SiteForm.submission.test.tsx`

## Current Status

### Working Tests:
- SiteHeader.test.tsx
- ListingCard.test.tsx
- LinkUtilities.test.tsx

### Tests Still Failing:
- SiteForm.validation.test.tsx
- SiteForm.submission.test.tsx

## Remaining Issues

The SiteForm tests are still failing because:

1. **Component State Management**: The SiteForm component uses a multi-step form with state management that's difficult to test. The tests expect to be able to directly trigger validation errors and see them immediately, but the component has more complex behavior.

2. **Error Display**: The tests look for specific error message text, but the component might display errors differently or in different locations than expected.

3. **Form Navigation**: The tests don't properly account for the multi-step nature of the form, trying to test validation across different steps without properly navigating between them.

## Recommendations

1. **Refactor Tests to Match Component Behavior**: Continue updating the tests to match how the component actually works, including:
   - Properly navigating between form steps
   - Looking for errors in the correct locations
   - Using the correct data-testid attributes

2. **Consider Component Refactoring**: The SiteForm component is complex and difficult to test. Consider refactoring it to:
   - Make validation more testable
   - Simplify the multi-step form logic
   - Make error messages more accessible to tests

3. **Use Component Props for Testing**: Use the `initialStep` prop more extensively to test specific steps without having to navigate through the entire form.

4. **Mock Dependencies**: Properly mock the router and other dependencies to avoid test failures due to external factors.

## Conclusion

The approach of modifying tests rather than components has been successful for simpler components like SiteHeader and ListingCard. However, for more complex components like SiteForm, a combination of test updates and potential component refactoring may be necessary to achieve reliable tests.

The current changes represent progress toward more maintainable tests, but additional work is needed to fully align the tests with the actual component behavior.
